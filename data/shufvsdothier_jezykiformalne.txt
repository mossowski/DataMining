In this paper we consider the hierarchy of languages which originates from the dot hierarchy (also called Brzozowski's hierarchy)
by replacing the operation of concatenation by the shuffle operation. It is proved that there are only two levels in this hierarchy, contrary to the dot hierarchy which is infinite (\cite{brzo:knas}).

The dot hierarchy, introduced by Brzozowski, is the result of the following operations: 
given a finite alphabet $\Sigma$ one starts with the family of one
word languages of type $\{a\}$, for any $a\in\Sigma$ or $\{\lambda\}$, $\lambda$ - the empty word. Closing this family under Boolean operations one 
obtains the level $0$ of the hierarchy. 
Each next level of the hierarchy is obtained via the closure of the previous level under concatenation and then again 
under Boolean operations. The union of all the these levels is the family of star-free or aperiodic languages, a proper subclass of regular languages.
In \cite{brzo:knas} it was shown that the dot hierarchy is infinite for any alphabet of two or more letters and is finite in case of one letter alphabet.
Here we consider a hierarchy which arises from the above one by replacing the concatenation by the shuffle operation. The shuffle of two words
is the set of all possible interleavings of the subwords of the words like shuffling two decks of cards.. In particular, the shuffle of two words contains 
their both concatenations. Since regular languages are closed under shuffle (\cite{hopc}), languages in this hierarchy are regular, as well. It appears
that the hierarchy is finite for any alphabet. This is in contrast with the results of \cite{jedr} where it was shown that the hierarchy with both shuffle 
and shuffle closure, is infinite. The collapse of the hierarchy is not surprising in view of the results of \cite{jedr:szep} 
where the following problem was investigated - how does the
introduction of the Boolean operator of intersection changes the expressive power of shuffle languages.

The paper is organized as follows. In Preliminaries we remind some useful definitions and define the hierarchy. 
In Section \ref{deco} we introduce the notion of a shuffle decomposition.
Following the methods of \cite{brzo:knas}
we establish, in Section \ref{repr} some general results on the levels $0$ and $1$ of the considered hierarchy. 
These results are then used in the final Section  
to establish the main result of the paper that the hierarchy collapses at level $1$ for any finite alphabet.

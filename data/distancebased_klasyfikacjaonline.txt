In this paper an on-line distance-based classifier is considered. The approach extends earlier proposed idea where a family of the online distance-based classifiers based on fuzzy C-means clustering followed by calculation of distances between cluster centroids and the incoming instance for which the class label is to be predicted, were suggested \cite{JP14}. %[Jedrzejowicz & Jedrzejowicz, 2014]. 
 Now,  instead of  fuzzy C-means clustering we use  kernel-based clustering method. The proposed  algorithm works in rounds,  where at each round a new instance is given and the algorithm makes a prediction.  After the true class of the instance is revealed, the learning algorithm updates its internal hypothesis through modifying the set of training examples used as a base for class prediction. A portfolio of similarity or distance measures used to construct the ensemble of classifiers is used to predict a class of coming instances.  The proposed approach is validated experimentally.

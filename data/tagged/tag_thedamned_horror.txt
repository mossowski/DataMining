I PRP
spoke VBD

I PRP

her PRP

dreariness NN

After IN

in IN

again RB

I PRP
half-rose VBP

But CC
Frances NNPS
did VBD
not RB
move VB

She PRP

her PRP
grey JJ
eyes NNS
upon IN
Oakley NNP
Street NNP
where WRB
the DT
evening VBG
mist NN
from IN

river NN
drew VBD
mournful JJ
perspectives NNS

It PRP
was VBD
late JJ
October NNP

We PRP
heard VBD
the DT
omnibuses NNS
thundering VBG
across IN

bridge NN

The DT
monotony NN
of IN
that DT
broad JJ
, ,
characterless JJ
street NN
seemed VBD
more JJR
than IN
usually RB
depressing VBG

Even RB
in IN
June NNP
sunshine VBP
it PRP
was VBD
dead JJ

but CC
with IN
autumn NN
its PRP$
melancholy NN
soaked VBD
into IN
every DT
house NN
between IN
King NNP

Road NNP

the DT
Embankment NNP

It PRP
washed VBD
thought VBN
into IN
the DT
past JJ

instead RB
of IN
inviting VBG
it PRP
hopefully RB
towards VBZ
the DT
future NN

For IN
me PRP
, ,
its PRP$
easy JJ
width NN
was VBD
an DT
avenue NN
through IN
which WDT
nameless NN
slums NNS
across IN
the DT
river NN
sent VBD
creeping VBG
messages NNS

depression NN

I PRP

November NNP

waving VBG

March NNP

Its PRP$
one CD
claim NN
upon IN
my PRP$

was VBD
that IN
the DT
south JJ
wind NN
swept VBD
sometimes RB
unobstructed VBN
up RP
it PRP

soft JJ
with IN

These DT
lugubrious JJ

I PRP
naturally RB

though IN
I PRP
never RB
ceased VBD

regret VB
the DT

Now RB

as IN

Closing VBG

I PRP

For IN

with IN

the DT

all PDT

her PRP$

She PRP
seemed VBD
not RB

lifeless NN

empty JJ

a DT

nothing NN

The DT

was VBD
disagreeable JJ

and CC
I PRP
put VBD
it PRP
by IN

Instantly NNP
she PRP
melted VBD
out RB

as IN
though IN
light JJ
thought NN

conjured VBN
up RP
a DT
phantom NN
that WDT

no DT

And CC
at IN
that DT

moment NN

singularly RB

my PRP$

along IN

I PRP

her PRP

a DT

me PRP

`` ``
There EX

my PRP$

`` ``

'' ''
What WP
brought VBD
the DT
outlandish JJ
notion NN

heaven VBN
only RB

The DT

she PRP

twice RB

the DT

Yet CC

All PDT

even RB

But CC
a DT

My PRP$

For IN
Mrs. NNP

The DT

It PRP

her PRP$

The DT

I PRP

I PRP

The DT

The DT

not RB

I PRP

I PRP

Frances NNS

no DT

It PRP

that IN

why WRB

Frances NNP

I PRP

Frances NNS

`` ``

my PRP$

I PRP

And CC
now RB
in IN

on IN

sitting VBG

all DT

these DT

vague JJ
Shadow NNP

Up IN

the DT

almost RB

The DT

Before IN

another DT

out RP

me PRP
: :
the DT
figure NN

Mrs. NNP

that WDT

It PRP

neither CC

I PRP

the DT

another DT

Our PRP$

Life NNP

I PRP

I PRP

probably RB
bird NN

that WDT

there EX

at IN

And CC
it PRP

Perhaps RB

too RB

it PRP

mere JJ
coincidence NN
that IN
I PRP

Mrs. NNP

several JJ

that IN
on IN

occasion NN
the DT
sight NN

gaunt NN

half-saturnine JJ

my PRP$

Once RB

I PRP

the DT

somewhat RB

then RB
again RB

simultaneously RB

It PRP

impossible JJ

We PRP

In IN

she PRP

taking VBG
her PRP$

Our PRP$

There EX

a DT

awkwardness NN

it PRP

there EX

something NN
about IN
the DT
`` ``

that IN
I PRP

While IN

however RB

London NNP

my PRP$

It PRP

the DT

up RB

On IN

the DT

back RB

how WRB

all DT

how WRB
I PRP

caught VBN
her PRP$

alone RB
that WDT
night NN

how WRB
she PRP

forever RB
coming VBG

with IN
her PRP$
lugubrious JJ

that IN
untidy JJ

at IN

that WDT

three CD

singed VBD

how WRB
the DT
impression NN
on IN
my PRP$
first JJ
arrival NN
at IN
The DT

was VBD
that IN
this DT

somehow RB
kept VBD
alive JJ

though IN
its PRP$
evidence NN

outwardly RB
suppressed VBN

the DT
influence NN
of IN
her PRP$
late JJ
employer NN

of IN
his PRP$
somber JJ

Somewhere RB
with IN
her PRP$
was VBD
associated VBN
the DT
idea NN
of IN
punishment NN

vindictiveness NN

revenge NN

I PRP
remembered VBD
again RB
suddenly RB
my PRP$
odd JJ
notion NN
that IN

keep VB
her PRP$
present JJ
mistress NN
here RB

a DT
prisoner NN
in IN

comfortless NN
house NN

that DT
really RB

in IN

she PRP

intensely RB

the DT

that WDT

Mabel NNP

a DT

All PDT
this DT

the DT
real JJ
Mrs. NNP

She PRP

decidedly RB
in IN

Shadow NNP

More JJR

she PRP
stood VBD
in IN
the DT

stealthily RB

as IN

consciously RB

I PRP

only RB

the DT

that IN
what WP

formidable JJ

I PRP

My PRP$

Otherwise VB

many JJ

Nothing NN

when WRB

for IN

that IN

I PRP

half-way RB
down IN

Two CD

At IN

I PRP

running VBG
down RP

it PRP

only RB
when WRB
she PRP

And CC
to TO

her PRP

incongruous JJ

I PRP
paused VBD

Through IN

the DT

more RBR

Her PRP$

that WDT

`` ``

the DT

That IN

before IN

She PRP

Her NNP

Her PRP$

its PRP$

so RB

The DT

She PRP

almost RB

She PRP

There EX

The DT

all DT

Only RB
the DT

The DT

`` ``

she PRP

Her PRP$

She PRP

For IN

Then RB
her PRP$

her PRP$

even RB

`` ``

she PRP

`` ``

Even RB

The DT

I PRP

red-hot JJ

That IN

But CC

The DT

The DT

knocking VBG

Merely RB
the DT

The DT

I PRP

while IN

I PRP

then RB
the DT

clock NN
by IN

deep RB
down RP

its PRP$

it PRP

the DT

dreading VBG

I PRP

If IN

in IN
the DT

the DT

So IN
I PRP
tiptoed VBP

where WRB
the DT

In IN

various JJ

I PRP

I PRP

And CC

to TO

the DT

It PRP

I PRP
paused VBD

staring VBG

I PRP

I PRP
fully RB

But CC
the DT

I PRP

Through IN

that WDT

an DT

again RB
I PRP

The DT

The DT

very RB
slowly RB

as IN

Resisting VBG
my PRP$

that IN
no DT

I PRP

For IN

that DT

Here RB

Either CC

It PRP

not RB
courage JJ

rather RB
a DT

the DT
feeling NN
that IN

that IN

I PRP

I PRP

only RB

that IN
the DT

in IN
this DT

that WDT

My PRP$

at IN

no DT

if IN
anything NN

my PRP$

I PRP
noticed VBD

that IN
the DT
two CD
swinging VBG
doors NNS

Also RB
that IN
the DT

some DT
ten JJ

still RB

from IN

them PRP

The DT
long JJ
green JJ

waved VBN

Then RB
I PRP
went VBD
stealthily RB
forward RB
down RP
the DT
narrow JJ
space NN

proud VB
even RB
that IN
I PRP

this DT
command NN

and CC
so RB
carefully RB
that IN
my PRP$
feet NNS
made VBN
no DT

upon IN
the DT
Japanese JJ
matting NN

It PRP
was VBD
a DT
journey NN
that WDT

I PRP
have VBP
no DT
idea NN
how WRB

I PRP

but CC
I PRP
remember VBP
that IN
I PRP
deliberately RB
examined VBD

peering VBG
with IN
particular JJ
closeness NN
into IN
the DT

I PRP
passed VBD
the DT
first JJ

doors NNS

and CC
the DT
passage NN
beyond IN
them PRP
widened VBD
out RP

shelves NNS

there EX

It PRP
narrowed VBD
again RB
presently RB

as IN
I PRP
entered VBD
the DT
second JJ

The DT
windows NNS
here RB
were VBD
higher JJR

and CC
marble JJ
statuettes NNS
of IN

lined VBD
the DT

watching VBG

Their PRP$
white JJ

yet RB

I PRP

They PRP

fastened VBN

Thus RB
all DT

And CC
so RB

at IN

I PRP

the DT
final JJ

which WDT

It PRP

No DT

They PRP

And CC
here RB

I PRP

the DT

The DT

It PRP

The DT

the DT

That DT

the DT

I PRP

that IN

Instantly RB
I PRP

My PRP$

And CC
the DT

I PRP

At IN

it PRP

this DT

but CC
as IN

I PRP

it PRP

though IN

by IN
the DT

just RB

It PRP

already RB

I PRP

then RB
that IN
its PRP$

that IN

The DT
prolonged JJ

of IN

died VBD

I PRP
heard VBD
the DT
footfall NN

shuffling VBG
upon IN

I PRP
heard VBD
another DT
sound NN
-- :
a DT
voice NN
, ,
low JJ

monotonous JJ

droning VBG
as IN
in IN
prayer NN

The DT
figure NN
was VBD
speaking VBG

It PRP
was VBD
a DT

And CC
she PRP
carried VBD
in IN
both DT

before IN
her PRP
a DT
small JJ

that WDT
faintly RB

a DT

And CC
then RB
I PRP

There EX

I PRP

flattening VBG
myself PRP

Her PRP$

ceased VBD
a DT
moment NN
, ,
as IN

turned VBD

carefully RB
drew VBD
the DT

together RB
behind IN
her PRP

dosing VBG
them PRP
with IN
one CD

Oblivious NNP

though IN
she PRP
actually RB

my PRP$

with IN
the DT

that WDT

she PRP
resumed VBD
her PRP
dreadful NN

solemn JJ

disappearing VBG
at IN

down IN
the DT

of IN
the DT

like IN

But CC
as IN
she PRP

her PRP

began VBD
again RB

so IN
that IN
I PRP
heard VBD
each DT

distinctly RB
as IN

uttered VBD
it PRP
, ,
her PRP$

her PRP
figure NN
upright JJ

as IN
though IN

moved VBD
at IN
the DT

of IN
a DT

: :
'' ''

'' ''
It PRP

repeated VBN
monotonously RB

over RB
again RB
, ,
droning VBG
down RP

the DT

as IN

until IN
at IN
length NN
both DT

faded VBN
into IN
the DT

at IN

For IN
a DT
time NN

I PRP
have VBP
no DT

of IN

I PRP
stood VBD
in IN
that DT

pressing VBG
my PRP$

would MD

The DT
dread NN
that WDT
presently RB

passed VBN
gradually RB
away RB

I PRP
realized VBD
that IN
the DT

emptied VBN

the DT

her PRP$

I PRP

Then RB
I PRP

again RB
the DT

realized VBD
that IN

after IN
a DT

I PRP
prepared VBD

I PRP
remember VBP
the DT

it PRP
cost VBD
me PRP

leave VB

darkness NN

At IN

I PRP

then RB

finding VBG
this DT

impossible JJ

turned VBD

regardless RB
that IN
my PRP$

the DT

A DT
wind NN
that WDT

mournfully RB
against IN

small JJ

seemed VBD

it PRP

cold JJ

and CC
every DT

I PRP
dreaded VBD

I PRP

I PRP

It PRP

I PRP

Some DT

`` ``

The DT

that IN

It PRP

They PRP

The DT

I PRP

My PRP$

The DT

Up IN

`` ``

Small NNP

again RB

And CC
behind IN

another DT

the DT

Both DT

just RB
outside IN

The DT

a DT

My PRP$
first JJ

my PRP$

going VBG
out RP

she PRP

I PRP

instead RB

it PRP

surer JJR

my PRP$

The DT
pistol NN
in IN

swung VBD
uselessly RB
against IN
my PRP$

I PRP
was VBD
flustered VBN
beyond IN

that IN
I PRP

`` ``

I PRP
said VBD
huskily RB

as IN
the DT
door NN
swung NN
wide JJ
and CC
a DT
shaft NN
of IN

fell VBD
upon IN
a DT

moving VBG

Mabel NNP

going VBG
down RP
the DT

Beyond IN

a DT

scarcely RB

`` ``

our PRP$

It PRP

a DT
horrible JJ
scene NN

Not RB
that IN
Mabel NNP
struggled VBD
in IN
the DT

but CC
that IN
she PRP
collapsed VBD
as IN
we PRP
caught VBD
her PRP

fell VBD
with IN
her PRP$
dead JJ

as IN

against IN

And CC
her PRP$

began VBD
again RB

They PRP

even RB
beneath IN

that WDT
Frances NNP

We PRP
carried VBD
her PRP
back RB

bedroom NN

where WRB
she PRP
lay VBD
down RB
peacefully RB
enough RB

It PRP

so RB
soon RB
over IN

The DT
rapidity NN
of IN
the DT
whole JJ

robbed VBD
it PRP

almost RB

It PRP

the DT
swiftness NN
of IN
something NN
remembered VBD
rather RB

of IN

She PRP
slept VBD
again RB
so RB
quickly RB
that IN
it PRP

almost RB
as IN

her PRP$

I PRP

I PRP
asked VBD

I PRP

and CC
my PRP$
help NN
was VBD
needed VBN
as RB
little JJ
as IN
the DT
protection NN

Frances NNS
was VBD
strangely RB
competent JJ
and CC
collected VBD

I PRP
lingered VBD
for IN
some DT
time NN
uselessly RB
by IN
the DT
door NN

till NN
at IN
length NN

looking VBG
up RP
with IN
a DT
sigh NN

she PRP
made VBD
a DT

for IN

`` ``

I PRP

`` ``

But CC

though RB
going VBG
out IN

I PRP
waited VBD
in IN
the DT

so RB
as IN

In IN

I PRP

but CC
not RB

It PRP

fifteen JJ

softly RB
behind IN

Leaning VBG

I PRP

And CC
she PRP

up RB

looking VBG

But CC
I PRP

her PRP

safely RB

and CC
the DT

the DT

I PRP
spent VBD
in IN
an DT

close RB

listening VBG

Soon NN
after IN
five CD

I PRP
heard VBD
Frances NNS
fumbling VBG

peering VBG
over IN

again RB

I PRP

she PRP

back RB

She PRP

Evidently RB

Then RB

then RB
only RB

I PRP

Chapter NN
IX NNP
It PRP
seems VBZ
I PRP
became VBD
a DT
mere JJ
spectator NN
after IN
that DT
; :
my PRP$
sister NN

was VBD
so RB
assured JJ
for IN
one CD
thing NN

, ,
for IN
another DT

the DT
responsibility NN
of IN
leaving VBG
Mabel NNP
alone RB

Frances NNS
laid VBD
it PRP
bodily RB
upon IN
my PRP$
shoulders NNS
-- :
was VBD
a DT
little RB
more JJR
than IN
I PRP
cared VBD
about RB

Moreover RB
, ,
when WRB
we PRP
all DT
three CD
met VBD
later RBR
in IN
the DT
day NN
, ,
things NNS
went VBD
on IN
so RB
exactly RB
as IN
before RB
, ,
so RB
absolutely RB
without IN
friction NN
or CC
distress NN
, ,
that IN
to TO
present VB
a DT
sudden JJ
, ,
obvious JJ
excuse NN
for IN
cutting VBG
our PRP$

short JJ
seemed VBD
ill-judged JJ

And CC
on IN
the DT
lowest JJS
grounds NNS
it PRP
would MD
have VB
been VBN
desertion NN
. .
At IN
any DT
rate NN
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
beyond IN
my PRP$
powers NNS
, ,
and CC
Frances NNP
was VBD
quite RB
firm JJ
that IN
she PRP
must MD
stay VB

We PRP
therefore VBP
did VBD
stay VB

Things NNS
that WDT
happen VBP
in IN
the DT
night NN
always RB
seem VBP
exaggerated JJ
and CC
distorted VBD
when WRB
the DT
sun NN
shines NNS
brightly RB
next JJ
morning NN
; :
no DT
one NN
can MD
reconstruct VB
the DT
terror NN
of IN
a DT
nightmare NN
afterwards NNS
, ,
nor CC
comprehend VBP
why WRB
it PRP
seemed VBD
so RB
overwhelming JJ
at IN
the DT
time NN

I PRP
slept VBD
till RB
ten JJ
o'clock NN
, ,
and CC
when WRB
I PRP
rang VBP
for IN
breakfast NN
, ,
a DT
note NN
from IN
my PRP$

lay VBD
upon IN
the DT
tray NN

its PRP$
message NN
of IN

couched VBN
in IN
a DT
calm NN

Mabel NN

she PRP
assured VBD
me PRP

was VBD
herself PRP
again RB
and CC
remembered VBD
nothing NN
of IN
what WP

there EX

no DT

I PRP

I PRP

Please NNP

all PDT
the DT

'' ''
She PRP

written VBN
`` ``
nonsense NN

first JJ
instead RB
of IN
`` ``

then RB
scratched VBD
it PRP
out RP

She PRP
wished VBD
to TO
convey VB
that DT
hysteria NN
had VBD
been VBN
abroad RB
in IN
the DT
night NN
, ,
and CC
I PRP
readily RB
gulped VBD
the DT
explanation NN
down RP
, ,
though IN
it PRP
could MD
not RB
satisfy VB
me PRP
in IN
the DT
smallest JJS
degree NN
. .
There EX
was VBD
another DT
week NN
of IN
our PRP$
visit NN
still RB
, ,
and CC
we PRP
stayed VBD
it PRP
out RP
to TO
the DT
end NN
without IN
disaster NN

My PRP$
desire NN
to TO
leave VB
at IN
times NNS
became VBD
that IN
frantic JJ
thing NN
, ,
desire NN
to TO
escape VB
; :
but CC
I PRP
controlled VBD
it PRP
, ,
kept VBD
silent JJ
, ,
watched JJ
and CC
wondered VBD

Nothing NN
happened VBD

As IN
before IN

and CC
everywhere RB
, ,
there EX
was VBD
no DT
sequence NN
of IN
development NN
, ,
no DT
connection NN
between IN
cause NN
and CC
effect NN
; :
and CC
climax VB
, ,
none NN
whatever WDT

The DT
thing NN
swayed VBD
up RB
and CC
down RB
, ,
backwards NNS
and CC
forwards NNS
like IN
a DT
great JJ
loose JJ
curtain NN
in IN
the DT
wind NN
, ,
and CC
I PRP
could MD
only RB
vaguely RB
surmise VB
what WP
caused VBD
the DT
draught NN
or CC
why WRB
there EX
was VBD
a DT
curtain NN
at IN
all DT

A DT
novelist NN
might MD
mold VB
the DT
queer NN
material NN
into IN
coherent JJ
sequence NN
that WDT
would MD
be VB
interesting JJ
but CC
could MD
not RB
be VB
true JJ

It PRP
remains VBZ
, ,
therefore RB
, ,
not RB
a DT
story NN
but CC
a DT
history NN
. .
Nothing NN
happened VBD
. .
Perhaps RB
my PRP$
intense JJ
dislike NN
of IN
the DT
fall NN
of IN
darkness NN
was VBD
due JJ
wholly RB
to TO
my PRP$
stirred JJ
imagination NN

and CC
perhaps RB
my PRP$
anger NN
when WRB
I PRP
learned VBD
that IN
Frances NNS
now RB
occupied VBP
a DT
bed NN
in IN
our PRP$
hostess NN

was VBD
unreasonable JJ

Nerves NNS

I PRP
was VBD
forever RB
on IN
the DT
lookout NN
for IN
some DT
event NN
that WDT

make VB

imperative NN

but CC
yet RB
that DT
never RB

itself PRP

I PRP
slept VBD
lightly RB

left VBD
my PRP$
door NN
ajar NN
to TO
catch VB
the DT
slightest JJS

even RB
made VBD
stealthy JJ
tours NNS
of IN
the DT
house NN
below-stairs NN
while IN
everybody NN
dreamed VBN
in IN
their PRP$

But CC
I PRP
discovered VBD
nothing NN
; :
the DT
doors NNS
were VBD
always RB
locked VBN

I PRP
neither CC
saw VBD
the DT

again RB
in IN
unreasonable JJ
times NNS
and CC
places NNS

nor CC
heard VBD
a DT
footstep NN
in IN
the DT

The DT
Noise NN
was VBD
never RB
once RB
repeated VBN

That DT
horrible JJ
, ,
ultimate JJ
thunder NN
, ,
my PRP$
intensest JJS
dread NN
of IN
all DT

lay VBD
withdrawn NN
into IN
the DT

whence NN
it PRP

twice RB
arisen VBN

And CC
though IN
in IN
my PRP$

it PRP
was VBD
sternly RB
denied JJ
existence NN
, ,
the DT
great JJ
black JJ
reason NN
for IN
the DT
fact NN
afflicted VBD
me PRP
unbelievably RB

Since IN
Mabel NNP

fruitless JJ
effort NN
to TO

the DT
Doors NNP
kept VBD
closed VBD
remorselessly RB

She PRP
had VBD
failed VBN
; :
they PRP
gave VBD
up RP
hope NN

For IN
this DT
was VBD
the DT
explanation NN
that WDT
haunted VBD
the DT
region NN
of IN
my PRP$
mind NN
where WRB
feelings NNS
stir NN
and CC
hint NN
before IN
they PRP
clothe VBP
themselves PRP
in IN
actual JJ

Only RB
I PRP
firmly RB
kept VBD
it PRP
there RB
; :
it PRP
never RB

But CC
, ,
if IN
my PRP$

my PRP$

it PRP

weak JJ
enough RB

Some DT

so IN
that DT

stalked VBD
behind IN

feeling VBG

through IN

the DT

Much RB

I PRP

the DT

subsequent JJ

my PRP$

I PRP
therefore VBP
leave VBP

just RB
as IN
my PRP$

left VBD
them PRP
unmentioned VBD
in IN
that DT
interminable JJ
final JJ

Our PRP$

went VBD

precisely RB

Mabel NNP

Frances NNS

keen VB

There EX

the DT

the DT

the DT

settling NN

that IN
it PRP

I PRP

this DT

the DT

even RB
up IN

The DT
robins NNS

believing VBG
no DT

possible JJ

They PRP

no DT

I PRP

Had NNP

he PRP

Most JJS

I PRP
spent VBD
writing VBG

but CC
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
pretence NN
at IN

rather RB
a DT
dangerous JJ
one CD

For IN
it PRP
stirred VBD
the DT

to TO
production NN

with IN
the DT
result NN
that IN

pouring VBG

With IN

it PRP

In IN

I PRP
found VBD
an DT

deliberate JJ

the DT

To TO

out IN

for IN

Too NNP

day NN

though IN

they PRP
held VBD
their PRP$

as IN

kind NN

They PRP
stirred VBD
moods NNS
already RB
in IN
me PRP
, ,
that DT

and CC
did VBD
not RB
introduce VB
entirely RB
new JJ

for IN
every DT

conceals NNS
ancestral JJ

that WDT

been VBN
cultivated VBN
in IN

along IN

of IN

Any DT
day NN
a DT

one CD

that DT

Thus VB
it PRP
came VBD
to TO
me PRP
, ,
at IN
any DT
rate NN

After IN
darkness IN
the DT
Inquisition NNP
paced VBD
the DT
empty JJ
corridors NNS
and CC
set VB
up RP
ghastly RB
apparatus RB
in IN
the DT
dismal JJ

; :
and CC
once RB
, ,
in IN
the DT
library NN

there EX
swept VBZ
over IN

that IN
easy JJ

delicious JJ
conviction NN
that IN
by IN
confessing VBG
my PRP$
wickedness NN
I PRP
could MD
resume VB
it PRP
later RB

since IN

is VBZ
expression NN

and CC
expression NN
brings NNS
relief NN
and CC
leaves VBZ
one CD
ready NN
to TO

And CC
in IN
such JJ
mood NN
I PRP
felt VBD
bitter JJ
and CC
unforgiving JJ
towards NNS
all DT
others NNS
who WP
thought VBD
differently RB

Another DT
time NN
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
Pagan JJ
thing NN
that WDT
assaulted VBD
me PRP
-- :
so RB
trivial JJ
yet RB
oh UH
, ,
so RB
significant JJ
at IN
the DT
time NN
-- :
when WRB
I PRP
dreamed VBD
that IN
a DT
herd NN
of IN

rolled VBN
up RP
with IN
a DT
great JJ
stamping NN
of IN
hoofs NN
round IN
the DT

to TO

it PRP

and CC
then RB
woke VBD
to TO
hear VB
the DT
horses NNS
tramping VBG
across IN
the DT

below IN
the DT
lawns NNS
; :
they PRP
neighed VBD
ominously RB
and CC
their PRP$
noisy JJ
panting NN
was VBD
audible JJ
as IN
if IN
it PRP
were VBD
just RB
outside JJ
my PRP$

But CC
the DT
tree JJ
episode NN
, ,
I PRP
think VBP
, ,
was VBD
the DT
most RBS
curious JJ
of IN
all DT
-- :
except IN
, ,
perhaps RB
, ,
the DT
incident NN
with IN
the DT
children NNS
which WDT
I PRP
shall MD
mention VB
in IN
a DT
moment NN
-- :
for IN
its PRP$
closeness NN
to TO
reality NN
was VBD
so RB
unforgettable JJ

Outside IN
the DT
east JJ
window NN
of IN
my PRP$

stood VBD
a DT
giant JJ
wellingtonia NN
on IN
the DT
lawn NN
, ,
its PRP$
head NN
rising VBG

with IN
the DT
upper JJ

It PRP
grew VBD
some DT
twenty JJ
feet NNS
away RB
, ,
planted VBN
on IN
the DT
highest JJS
terrace NN
, ,
and CC
I PRP
often RB
saw VBD
it PRP
when WRB
closing VBG
my PRP$
curtains NNS
for IN
the DT
night NN
, ,
noticing VBG
how WRB
it PRP
drew VBD
its PRP$
heavy JJ
skirts NNS
about IN
it PRP
, ,
and CC
how WRB
the DT
light NN
from IN
other JJ
windows NNS
threw VBD
glimmering VBG
streaks NNS
and CC
patches NNS
that WDT
turned VBD
it PRP
into IN
the DT
semblance NN
of IN
a DT
towering NN
, ,
solemn JJ
image NN

It PRP
stood VBD
there EX
then RB
so RB
strikingly RB
, ,
somehow VBP
like IN
a DT
great JJ
old-world JJ
idol NN
, ,
that IN
it PRP
claimed VBD
attention NN

Its PRP$
appearance NN
was VBD
curiously RB
formidable JJ

Its PRP$
branches NNS
rustled VBN
without IN
visibly RB
moving VBG
and CC
it PRP
had VBD
a DT
certain JJ
portentous JJ
, ,
forbidding VBG
air NN
, ,
so RB
grand JJ
and CC
dark JJ
and CC
monstrous JJ
in IN
the DT
night NN
that IN
I PRP
was VBD
always RB
glad JJ
when WRB
my PRP$
curtains NNS
shut VB
it PRP
out RP

Yet CC
, ,
once RB
in IN
bed NN
, ,
I PRP
had VBD
never RB
thought VBN
about IN
it PRP
one CD
way NN
or CC
the DT
other JJ
, ,
and CC
by IN
day NN
had VBD
certainly RB
never RB
sought VBD
it PRP
out RP
. .
One CD
night NN
, ,
then RB
, ,
as IN
I PRP
went VBD
to TO
bed NN
and CC
closed VBD
this DT
window NN
against IN
a DT
cutting VBG
easterly RB
wind NN
, ,
I PRP
saw VBD
-- :
that IN
there EX
were VBD
two CD
of IN
these DT
trees NNS
. .
A DT
brother NN
wellingtonia NN
rose VBD
mysteriously RB
beside IN
it PRP
, ,
equally RB
huge JJ
, ,
equally RB
towering VBG
, ,
equally RB
monstrous JJ
. .
The DT
menacing VBG
pair NN
of IN
them PRP
faced VBD
me PRP
there EX
upon IN
the DT
lawn NN
. .
But CC
in IN
this DT
new JJ
arrival NN
lay VBD
a DT
strange JJ
suggestion NN
that WDT
frightened VBD
me PRP
before IN
I PRP
could MD
argue VB
it PRP
away RB
. .
Exact JJ
counterpart NN
of IN
its PRP$
giant JJ
companion NN
, ,
it PRP
revealed VBD
also RB
that IN
gross JJ
, ,
odious JJ
quality NN
that IN
all DT
my PRP$
sister NN

paintings NNS
held VBD
. .
I PRP
got VBD
the DT
odd JJ
impression NN
that IN
the DT
rest NN
of IN
these DT
trees NNS
, ,
stretching VBG
away RB
dimly RB
in IN
a DT
troop NN
over IN
the DT
farther NN
lawns NNS
, ,
were VBD
similar JJ
, ,
and CC
that IN
, ,
led VBN
by IN
this DT
enormous JJ
pair NN
, ,
they PRP
had VBD
all DT
moved VBN
boldly RB
closer RBR
to TO
my PRP$

At IN
the DT
same JJ
moment NN
a DT
blind NN
was VBD
drawn VBN
down RP
over IN
an DT
upper JJ
room NN
; :
the DT
second JJ
tree NN
disappeared VBD
into IN
the DT
surrounding VBG
darkness NN

It PRP
was VBD
, ,
of IN
course NN
, ,
this DT
chance NN
light VBD
that WDT
had VBD
brought VBN
it PRP
into IN
the DT
field NN
of IN
vision NN
, ,
but CC
when WRB
the DT
black JJ
shutter NN
dropped VBD
over IN
it PRP
, ,
hiding VBG
it PRP
from IN
view NN
, ,
the DT
manner NN
of IN
its PRP$
vanishing NN
produced VBD
the DT
queer NN
effect NN
that IN
it PRP
had VBD
slipped VBN
into IN
its PRP$
companion NN
-- :
almost RB
that IN
it PRP
had VBD
been VBN
an DT
emanation NN
of IN
the DT
one CD
I PRP
so RB
disliked VBD
, ,
and CC
not RB
really RB
a DT
tree NN
at IN
all DT

In IN
this DT
way NN
the DT
garden NN
turned VBD
vehicle NN
for IN
expressing VBG
what WP

behind IN
it PRP
all DT
... :
! .
The DT
behavior NN
of IN
the DT
doors NNS

the DT
little JJ
, ,
ordinary JJ

seems VBZ
scarcely RB
worth JJ
mention NN
at IN
all DT
, ,
their PRP$
queer JJ
way NN
of IN
opening NN

shutting NN
of IN
their PRP$

; :
for IN
this DT
was VBD
accountable JJ
in IN
a DT
hundred JJ
natural JJ
ways NNS

and CC
to TO
tell VB
the DT
truth NN
, ,
I PRP
never RB
caught VBD
one CD
in IN
the DT
act NN
of IN
moving VBG

Indeed RB
, ,
only RB
after IN
frequent JJ
repetitions NNS
did VBD
the DT
detail NN
force NN
itself PRP
upon IN
me PRP
, ,
when WRB
, ,
having VBG
noticed VBN
one CD

I PRP
noticed VBD
all DT

It PRP
produced VBD
, ,
however RB
, ,
the DT
unpleasant JJ
impression NN
of IN
a DT
continual JJ
coming NN
and CC
going VBG
in IN
the DT

, ,
as IN
though IN

screened VBD
cleverly RB

purposely RB
from IN

some DT
one CD

constant JJ
invisible JJ

Upon IN

I PRP
do VBP
not RB
venture NN
, ,
individually RB
so RB
trivial JJ

but CC
taken VBN
all DT

insolent JJ

But CC
the DT
episode NN
of IN

above IN

was VBD
different JJ

And CC
I PRP
give VBP
it PRP
because IN
it PRP
showed VBD
how WRB
vividly RB
the DT
intuitive JJ
child-mind NN
received VBD
the DT
impression NN

one CD
impression NN

at IN
any DT

of IN
what WP
was VBD
in IN

It PRP
may MD
be VB
told VBN
in IN

very RB

I PRP

the DT

children NNS

and CC
that IN
the DT

in IN
Mr. NNP
Franklyn's NNP
service NN
; :
but CC
of IN
neither DT
point NN

I PRP
quite RB
positive JJ

I PRP
heard VBD
screaming VBG
in IN
the DT
rose-garden JJ
that WDT
runs VBZ
along IN
the DT
stable JJ
walls NNS
-- :
it PRP
was VBD
one CD
afternoon NN
not RB
far RB
from IN
the DT
tea-hour NN
-- :
and CC
on IN
hurrying VBG
up RP
I PRP
found VBD
a DT
little JJ
girl NN
of IN
nine CD

ten NNS
fastened VBN

two CD

The DT

white JJ

but CC
the DT

were VBD
laughing VBG

talking VBG
among IN
themselves PRP
so RB
busily RB
while IN
they PRP
picked VBD
that IN
they PRP
did VBD
not RB
notice VB
my PRP$
abrupt JJ
arrival NN

Some DT
game NN
, ,
I PRP
understood VBD

was VBD
in IN
progress NN

but CC
a DT
game NN
that WDT
had VBD
become VBN
too RB
serious JJ
for IN
the DT
happiness NN
of IN
the DT

, ,
for IN
there EX
was VBD
a DT
fear NN
in IN
the DT

eyes NNS
that WDT

a DT
very RB
genuine JJ
fear NN
indeed RB

I PRP
unfastened VBD
her PRP
at IN
once RB

the DT
ropes NNS

so RB
loosely RB

clumsily RB
knotted VBD
that IN

her PRP$

it PRP

that IN

her PRP$

She PRP
collapsed VBD
a DT

upon IN

then RB
picked VBD
up RP

tiny JJ

dived VBD
away RB
at IN
full JJ
speed NN

safety NN
of IN
the DT

There EX

no DT

but CC
she PRP
ran VBD
as IN

and CC
I PRP
divined VBD
that IN
some DT
horrid JJ
boys NNS

It PRP
was VBD
probably RB
mere JJ
thoughtlessness RB

as IN
cruelty NN
with IN

usually RB

but CC
something NN
in IN
me PRP
decided VBD

exactly RB
what WP
it PRP

And CC
the DT
boys NNS

not RB
one CD

alarmed VBD

merely RB

shyly NN
when WRB

told VBD
me PRP
frankly VB
what WP
their PRP$
`` ``

There EX

no DT

`` ``

the DT

The DT

slunk VBD

yet RB
not RB

I PRP

convinced VBD

It PRP

I PRP

impossible JJ

yet RB
on IN

each DT
more JJR

I PRP

as IN

I PRP

Thus NNP

I PRP

The DT

The DT

I PRP

this DT

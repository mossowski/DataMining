In IN
this DT

we PRP
consider VBP
the DT
hierarchy NN

the DT

hierarchy NN
( (
also RB

Brzozowski NNP

replacing VBG

The DT

the DT

Closing VBG

Each DT

again RB
under IN

The DT

all PDT
the DT

the DT

In IN
\cite JJ
{ (
brzo NN

it PRP
was VBD
shown VBN
that IN
the DT
dot NN
hierarchy NN
is VBZ
infinite JJ
for IN
any DT
alphabet NN
of IN
two CD

more JJR
letters NNS
and CC
is VBZ
finite VBN
in IN
case NN
of IN
one CD

Here RB
we PRP
consider VBP
a DT
hierarchy NN
which WDT
arises VBZ
from IN
the DT
above IN
one CD
by IN
replacing VBG
the DT
concatenation NN
by IN
the DT
shuffle NN
operation NN

The DT
shuffle NN
of IN
two CD
words NNS
is VBZ
the DT
set NN
of IN
all DT
possible JJ
interleavings NNS
of IN
the DT
subwords NNS
of IN
the DT
words NNS
like IN
shuffling VBG
two CD

of IN
cards.. NN
In IN
particular JJ
, ,
the DT
shuffle NN
of IN
two CD
words NNS
contains VBZ
their PRP$
both DT
concatenations NNS

Since IN
regular JJ
languages NNS
are VBP
closed VBN
under IN
shuffle NN
( (
\cite JJ
{ (
hopc VB

) )
, ,
languages VBZ
in IN
this DT
hierarchy NN
are VBP
regular JJ
, ,
as RB
well RB

It PRP
appears VBZ
that IN
the DT
hierarchy NN
is VBZ
finite JJ
for IN
any DT
alphabet NN

This DT

with IN
the DT

that IN

The DT

The DT
paper NN
is VBZ
organized VBN
as IN
follows VBZ

In IN
Preliminaries NNPS
we PRP
remind VBP
some DT
useful JJ
definitions NNS
and CC
define VB
the DT

In IN
Section NNP
\ref NNP
{ (
deco NN
} )
we PRP
introduce VBP
the DT
notion NN
of IN
a DT
shuffle JJ
decomposition NN

Following VBG
the DT
methods NNS
of IN
\cite NNP
{ (
brzo NN
: :
knas NNS
} )
we PRP
establish VB
, ,
in IN
Section NNP
\ref NNP

some DT
general JJ

on IN
the DT
levels NNS

of IN
the DT

These DT
results NNS
are VBP
then RB
used VBN
in IN
the DT
final JJ
Section NN
to TO
establish VB
the DT
main JJ

I PRP
once RB

It PRP

as IN

it PRP

the DT

It PRP

there EX

You PRP

from IN

Our PRP$

they PRP

I PRP

Well IN
it PRP

early JJ
April NNP

we PRP

at IN

I PRP

when WRB

I PRP

We PRP

We PRP

at IN

As IN
we PRP
went VBD
down RB
into IN
it PRP
we PRP
saw VBD
the DT

go VBP
up RP
the DT

like IN

the DT
evening NN

We PRP

we PRP

out RP

the DT

still RB

It PRP

dawn VB
on IN

then RB
that IN
we PRP

I PRP
took VBD
a DT
deep JJ

when WRB

the DT

Spring NNP

as IN

Our PRP$

another DT

at IN

a DT

a DT

the DT
sunlight NN
on IN

danced VBN
like IN
a DT

all DT
along IN

old JJ

were VBD
frowning VBG

but CC
they PRP
dreamed VBD
of IN
Spring NN

The DT
`` ``

had VBD
fallen VBN

were VBD
far RB
behind IN

my PRP$
only JJ

my PRP$

who WP

a DT

instinct NN

and CC
a DT
personal JJ
animosity NN
against IN
a DT

that WDT
even RB
embittered VBD
his PRP$

Across IN
the DT
valley NN
the DT
fox JJ
went VBD
as RB
straight VBN
as IN

and CC
again RB
we PRP
went VBD
without IN

straight RB
through IN

at IN

I PRP
remember VBP
hearing VBG

as IN
they PRP
walked VBD
home NN
from IN

and CC
sometimes RB
children NNS

the DT

came VBD
up RB
from IN

village NN
to TO
the DT

at IN
the DT
top NN
of IN
the DT
valley NN

After IN
that DT
we PRP
saw VBD
no DT
more RBR

but CC
valley NN
after IN
valley NN
arose NN
and CC
fell VBD
before RB
us PRP
as IN
though IN

voyaging VBG
some DT
strange JJ

stormy JJ

all PDT
the DT

before IN

the DT

went VBD
dead JJ
up-wind JJ
like IN

There EX

no DT

my PRP$

me PRP

we PRP

both DT

our PRP$

as IN

Two CD

three CD

we PRP
checked VBD
in IN
those DT
great JJ
lonely JJ

beyond IN
the DT
village NN
, ,
but CC
I PRP
began VBD
to TO
have VB
inspirations NNS
, ,
I PRP
felt VBD
a DT
strange JJ
certainty NN
within IN
me PRP
that IN
this DT
fox NN
was VBD
going VBG
on IN
straight JJ
up-wind JJ
till NN
he PRP
died VBD
or CC
until IN
night NN
came VBD
and CC
we PRP
could MD
hunt VB
no RB

so IN
I PRP
reversed VBD
ordinary JJ

and CC
only RB
cast VBD
straight JJ
ahead RB
and CC
always RB
we PRP
picked VBD
up RP
the DT
scent NN
again RB
at IN
once RB

I PRP
believe VBP
that IN
this DT
fox NN
was VBD
the DT
last JJ
one CD
left VBD
in IN
the DT
villa-haunted JJ
lands NNS
and CC
that IN
he PRP
was VBD
prepared VBN
to TO
leave VB
them PRP
for IN
remote NN

far RB
from IN

that IN
if IN

the DT
following JJ

he PRP
would MD
not RB
have VB
been VBN
there RB
, ,
and CC
that IN
we PRP
just RB
happened VBD
to TO
hit VB
off RP
his PRP$
journey NN

Evening VBG
began VBD
to TO
descend VB
upon IN
the DT
valleys NNS
, ,
still RB
the DT
hounds NNS
drifted VBN
on IN
, ,
like IN
the DT
lazy NN
but CC
unresting JJ
shadows NNS
of IN
clouds NNS
upon IN
a DT
summer NN
's POS
day NN
, ,
we PRP
heard VBD
a DT
shepherd NN
calling VBG
to TO
his PRP$
dog NN
, ,
we PRP
saw VBD
two CD
maidens NNS
move VBP
towards IN
a DT
hidden JJ
farm NN
, ,
one CD
of IN
them PRP
singing VBG
softly RB
; :
no DT
other JJ
sounds NNS
, ,
but CC
ours PRP
, ,
disturbed VBD
the DT
leisure NN
and CC
the DT
loneliness NN
of IN
haunts NNS
that WDT
seemed VBD
not RB
yet RB
to TO
have VB
known VBN
the DT
inventions NNS
of IN

gun-powder NN
( (
even RB
as IN

in IN

And CC
now RB
the DT
day NN
and CC
our PRP$
horses NNS
were VBD
wearing VBG
out RP
, ,
but CC
that IN
resolute JJ
fox JJ
held VBN
on IN

I PRP
began VBD
to TO
work VB
out RP
the DT
run NN
and CC
to TO
wonder VB
where WRB
we PRP
were VBD

The DT
last JJ
landmark NN
I PRP
had VBD
ever RB
seen VBN
before RB
must MD
have VB
been VBN
over IN
five CD
miles NNS
back RB
and CC
from IN
there RB
to TO
the DT
start NN
was VBD
at IN

ten JJ
miles NNS
more RBR

If IN
only RB
we PRP
could MD
kill VB

Then RB
the DT
sun NN
set NN

I PRP
wondered VBD
what WP
chance NN
we PRP
had VBD
of IN
killing VBG
our PRP$
fox NN

I PRP
looked VBD
at IN
James NNP
' POS
face NN
as IN
he PRP
rode VBD
beside IN
me PRP

He PRP
did VBD
not RB
seem VB
to TO
have VB
lost VBN
any DT
confidence NN
yet RB
his PRP$
horse NN
was VBD
as RB
tired VBN
as IN
mine NN

It PRP
was VBD
a DT
good JJ
clear JJ
twilight NN
and CC
the DT
scent NN
was VBD
as RB
strong JJ
as IN
ever RB
, ,
and CC
the DT
fences NNS
were VBD
easy JJ
enough RB
, ,
but CC
those DT
valleys NNS
were VBD
terribly RB
trying VBG
and CC
they PRP
still RB
rolled VBD
on IN
and CC
on IN

It PRP
looked VBD
as IN
if IN
the DT
light NN
would MD
outlast VB
all DT
possible JJ
endurance NN
both DT
of IN
the DT
fox NN
and CC
the DT

, ,
if IN
the DT

good JJ
and CC
he PRP
did VBD
not RB
go VB

otherwise RB
night NN
would MD
end VB
it PRP

For IN
long RB
we PRP
had VBD
seen VBN
no DT

and CC
no DT

only RB
chalk VB
slopes NNS
with IN
the DT
twilight NN
on IN
them PRP
, ,
and CC
here RB
and CC
there RB
some DT
sheep NN
, ,
and CC
scattered VBD
copses NNS
darkening VBG
in IN
the DT
evening NN

At IN
some DT
moment NN
I PRP
seemed VBD
to TO
realise VB
all DT
at IN
once RB
that IN
the DT
light NN
was VBD
spent VBN
and CC
that IN
darkness NN
was VBD
hovering VBG
, ,
I PRP
looked VBD
at IN
James NNP
, ,
he PRP
was VBD
solemnly RB
shaking VBG
his PRP$

Suddenly RB
in IN
a DT
little JJ
wooded JJ

we PRP
saw VBD
climb NN
over IN
the DT

the DT
red-brown JJ
gables NNS
of IN
a DT
queer NN
old JJ
house NN
, ,
at IN
that DT
instant NN
I PRP
saw VBD
the DT
fox NN
scarcely RB
heading VBG
by IN
fifty JJ
yards NNS

We PRP
blundered VBD
through IN
a DT
wood NN
into IN
full JJ

of IN
the DT

, ,
but CC
no DT

led VBD
up RB

it PRP

even RB

any DT

Already JJ

there RB
in IN

We PRP
were VBD
in IN
a DT

and CC
a DT
fine JJ
park NN

but CC
unkempt JJ
beyond IN

; :
brambles NNS

It PRP
was VBD
too RB
dark JJ
to TO

the DT

any DT

but CC
we PRP
knew VBD
he PRP
was VBD
dead JJ

, ,
the DT

were VBD
just RB

and CC
a DT
four-foot JJ
railing NN

I PRP
should MD

it PRP
on IN
a DT
fresh JJ
horse NN
the DT
beginning NN

here RB
was VBD
a DT

But CC
what WP
a DT

an DT

standing VBG
out RP

the DT

up RP

slipping VBG

as IN
I PRP

I PRP

My NNP

rose VBD
about IN
eight CD

took VBD
it PRP
fair JJ
with IN
his PRP$

the DT
oak NN

flew VBD
into IN

it PRP
rotten VBZ

And CC
then RB
we PRP
were VBD
on IN
a DT

and CC
at IN

of IN
it PRP
the DT

tumbling VBG
over IN

Fox NNP

all DT

together RB
at IN

We PRP
made VBD
some DT
noise NN
then RB
, ,
but CC
nobody NN
came VBD
out IN

I PRP

I PRP

marvellously RB

after IN
a DT

while IN
the DT

opened VBD
a DT

revealing VBG
a DT

with IN

in IN
it PRP

the DT
shabbiest JJS

that IN

I PRP

Sir NNP

I PRP

`` ``

`` ``

Then RB

He PRP

a DT

his PRP$

there EX

Then RB

At IN

It PRP

it PRP

The DT

Besides IN

I PRP
had VBD
decided VBN
one CD

to TO
do VB
no DT
London NNP
season NN
; :
partly RB
because IN

ugliness NN

partly RB
because IN

unresisted JJ

partly RB
perhaps RB
because IN
some DT
pet JJ
parrots NNS
in IN
the DT
oblong NN
where WRB
I PRP
lived VBD
had VBD
learned VBN
to TO
imitate VB
cab-whistles NNS
; :
but CC
chiefly VBP
because IN
of IN
late JJ
there EX

seized VBN
me PRP
in IN
London NNP
a DT
quite RB
unreasonable JJ
longing NN
for IN
large JJ
woods NNS

while IN
the DT
very RB
thought NN

every DT

the DT

worse JJR
till IN

So CC
I PRP
took VBD
a DT
stick NN

began VBD
walking VBG
northwards NNS

starting VBG

sleeping VBG

where WRB
one NN

the DT

English NNP

where WRB
one CD

a DT

though IN
the DT

be VB
dirty VBN
the DT
windows NNS
opened VBD
so RB
that IN

At IN

then RB
one CD

in IN

up RP

I PRP

two CD

such JJ

I PRP

It PRP

there EX

the DT

by IN

I PRP

It PRP

following VBG
sometimes RB
sheep VB

And CC
hearing VBG

they PRP

One CD
well-meant JJ
warning NN
they PRP

me PRP
as IN

the DT

And CC
late JJ
that IN

I PRP

the DT

sheltering VBG

that IN
Atlas-like NNP
held VBD
up RP
those DT

They PRP
knew VBD
less JJR

they PRP

There EX

an DT

that WDT

whence NN
in IN
the DT
morning NN

equipped VBN

I PRP
set VBP
out RP

And CC
there EX
he PRP
was VBD
on IN
the DT
edge NN

Mallington NNP
Moor NNP
standing VBG
motionless NN

gazing VBG
stupidly RB

his PRP$

his PRP$

had VBD
a DT
blear JJ

he PRP
was VBD
quite RB
sober JJ

wherein WP
all DT

And CC
then RB
and CC
there RB
I PRP
asked VBD
him PRP

he PRP
said VBD
he PRP
had VBD
never RB

any DT
such JJ

And CC
I PRP
said VBD
, ,
`` ``

'' ''
And CC
he PRP
looked VBD
angrily RB

but CC
when WRB
he PRP
saw VBD
me PRP
draw VB
from IN
amongst JJ
my PRP$
purchases NNS
a DT
full JJ
bottle NN

a DT
big JJ
glass NN
he PRP
became VBD
more RBR

As IN
I PRP
poured VBD
out RP
the DT
whiskey NN
I PRP
asked VBD
him PRP
again RB
about IN
the DT
marble JJ
city NN
on IN
Mallington NNP
Moor NNP
but CC
he PRP
seemed VBD
quite RB
honestly RB

nothing NN

The DT
amount NN

he PRP
drank VBD
was VBD
quite RB
incredible JJ

but CC
I PRP
seldom RB
express VBP

and CC
once RB
more JJR
I PRP
asked VBD
him PRP
the DT

His PRP$
hand NN
was VBD
steadier JJR
now RB

his PRP$

more RBR
intelligent JJ

he PRP
said VBD
that IN
he PRP

something NN

but CC
his PRP$
memory NN
was VBD
evidently RB
blurred VBN
and CC
he PRP
was VBD
still RB
unable JJ

useful JJ

I PRP
consequently RB
gave VBD
him PRP
another DT
tumbler NN

which WDT
he PRP
drank VBD
off RP

the DT
first JJ
without IN
any DT
water NN

and CC
almost RB
at IN

he PRP

a DT

The DT
trembling NN
in IN

stopped VBD

his PRP$
eye NN
became VBD

he PRP

readily RB

what WP

his PRP$

His PRP$

no DT

without IN
at IN

some DT

Yet CC
it PRP

pleasant JJ

me PRP

recovered VBD

his PRP$

He PRP

the DT

And CC
they PRP

even RB

And CC
there EX

I PRP

I PRP

my PRP$

So IN
I PRP

him PRP

after IN
more JJR

I PRP

I PRP

the DT

it PRP

I PRP

Heaven NNP

then RB

Whiskey NNP

with IN

it PRP

It PRP

he PRP

bitter JJ

the DT

in IN

I PRP

it PRP

I PRP
followed VBD
that IN

I PRP

where WRB
the DT

I PRP

I PRP

And CC
just RB

before IN
the DT
gloaming NN
fell VBD
on IN
that DT
desolate JJ

I PRP
suddenly RB
saw VBD
a DT
long JJ
high JJ
wall NN

whiteness NN
with IN
pinnacles NNS
here RB
and CC
there RB
thrown VBN
up RP
above IN
it PRP

floating VBG
towards NNS
me PRP
silent JJ
and CC
grim JJ
as IN

secret JJ

and CC
knew VBD
it PRP
for IN
that DT
evil JJ
thing NN
the DT
mist NN

The DT
sun NN
, ,
though RB
low JJ

was VBD
shining VBG
on IN
every DT
sprig NN
of IN
heather NN

the DT
green JJ

scarlet NN
mosses NNS
were VBD
shining VBG
with IN
it PRP
too RB

it PRP
seemed VBD
incredible JJ
that IN
in IN
three CD
minutes NNS

all PDT
those DT

would MD
be VB
gone VBN
and CC
nothing NN
left VBD
all DT

but CC
a DT
grey JJ
darkness NN

I PRP
gave VBD
up RP
hope NN
of IN

the DT

that DT
day NN
, ,
a DT
broader JJR
path NN
than IN
mine NN
could MD

quite RB
easily RB

I PRP
hastily RB
chose VBD
for IN
my PRP$
bed NN
a DT
thick JJ
patch NN
of IN
heather NN
, ,
wrapped VBD
myself PRP
in IN
a DT
waterproof JJ
cloak NN
, ,
and CC
lay VBD
down RB
and CC
made VBD
myself PRP
comfortable JJ
. .
And CC
then RB
the DT
mist NN
came VBD
. .
It PRP
came VBD
like IN
the DT
careful JJ
pulling NN
of IN
lace NN
curtains NNS
, ,
then RB
like IN
the DT
drawing NN
of IN
grey JJ
blinds NNS
; :
it PRP
shut VBD
out RP
the DT
horizon NN
to TO
the DT
north NN
, ,
then RB
to TO
the DT
east NN

west NN
; :
it PRP
turned VBD
the DT
whole JJ
sky NN
white JJ
and CC
hid VB
the DT
moor NN
; :
it PRP
came VBD
down RB
on IN
it PRP
like IN
a DT
metropolis NN
, ,
only RB
utterly JJ
silent NN
, ,
silent JJ
and CC
white JJ
as IN

And CC
then RB
I PRP
was VBD
glad NN
of IN
that DT
strange JJ
strong JJ
rum NN
, ,
or CC
whatever VB
it PRP
was VBD
in IN
the DT
flask NN
that IN

for IN
I PRP
did VBD
not RB

clear VB

night NN

and CC
I PRP
feared VBD
the DT
night NN
would MD
be VB
cold JJ

So RB
I PRP
nearly RB
emptied VBD
the DT
flask NN
; :
and CC
, ,
sooner JJR
than IN
I PRP
expected VBD
, ,
I PRP
fell VBD
asleep RB
, ,
for IN
the DT
first JJ
night NN
out RP
as IN
a DT
rule NN
one CD

not RB
sleep VB
at IN
once RB
but CC

kept VBN
awake RB
some DT
while NN
by IN
the DT
little JJ
winds NNS
and CC
the DT
unfamiliar JJ
sound NN
of IN
the DT
things NNS
that WDT

at IN
night NN

and CC
that IN
cry NN
to TO
one CD
another DT
far-off NN
with IN

faint JJ

; :
one CD

them PRP
afterwards NNS
when WRB
one CD

again RB

But CC
I PRP
heard VBP
none NN
of IN
these DT
sounds NNS
in IN
the DT
mist NN
that IN
evening VBG

And CC
then RB
I PRP
woke VBD
and CC
found VBD
that IN
the DT
mist NN
was VBD
gone VBN
and CC
the DT
sun NN
was VBD
just RB
disappearing VBG
under IN
the DT
moor NN
, ,
and CC
I PRP
knew VBD
that IN
I PRP
had VBD
not RB
slept VBN
for IN
as RB
long JJ
as IN
I PRP
thought VBD

And CC
I PRP
decided VBD
to TO
go VB
on IN
while IN
I PRP
could MD
, ,
for IN
I PRP
thought VBD
that IN
I PRP
was VBD
not RB
very RB
far RB
from IN
the DT
city NN

I PRP
went VBD
on IN
and CC
on IN
along IN
the DT
twisty JJ
track NN
, ,
bits NNS
of IN
the DT
mist NN
came VBD
down RB
and CC
filled VBD
the DT
hollows NNS
but CC
lifted VBD
again RB
at IN
once RB
so IN
that IN
I PRP
saw VBD
my PRP$
way NN

The DT
twilight NN
faded VBD
as IN
I PRP
went VBD
, ,
a DT
star NN
appeared VBN
, ,
and CC
I PRP
was VBD
able JJ
to TO
see VB
the DT
track NN
no RB
longer RBR

I PRP
could MD
go VB
no DT
further RB
that IN
night NN
, ,
yet CC
before IN
I PRP
lay VBP
down RP
to TO
sleep VB
I PRP
decided VBD
to TO
go VB
and CC
look VB
over IN
the DT
edge NN
of IN
a DT
wide JJ
depression NN
in IN
the DT
moor NN
that IN
I PRP
saw VBD
a DT
little JJ
way NN
off IN

So CC
I PRP
left VBD
the DT
track NN
and CC
walked VBD
a DT
few JJ
hundred JJ
yards NNS
, ,
and CC
when WRB
I PRP
got VBD
to TO
the DT
edge NN
the DT
hollow NN
was VBD
full JJ
of IN
mist NN
all DT
white JJ
underneath IN
me PRP

Another DT
star NN
appeared VBD
and CC
a DT
cold JJ
wind NN
arose NN
, ,
and CC
with IN
the DT
wind NN
the DT
mist NN
flapped VBD
away RB
like IN
a DT
curtain NN

And CC
there EX
was VBD
the DT
city NN

Nothing VBG
the DT
shepherd NN
had VBD
said VBD
was VBD
the DT
least JJS
untrue JJ
or CC
even RB
exaggerated JJ

The DT
poor JJ
old JJ
man NN
had VBD
told VBN
the DT
simple JJ
truth NN
, ,
there EX
is VBZ
not RB
a DT
city NN
like IN
it PRP
in IN

world NN

What WP
he PRP
had VBD
called VBN
thin JJ
spires NNS
were VBD
minarets NNS
, ,
but CC
the DT
little JJ
domes NNS
on IN

were VBD
clearly RB
pure JJ
gold NN
as IN
he PRP
said VBD

There EX
were VBD
the DT
marble JJ

he PRP
described VBD
and CC
the DT
pure JJ
white JJ
palaces NNS
covered VBN
with IN

and CC
hundreds NNS
of IN

The DT
city NN
was VBD
obviously RB

the DT
East NNP

yet RB
where WRB
there EX

crescents NNS
on IN

of IN

there EX

golden JJ

and CC
wherever RB
one CD
looked VBD
one CD

things NNS
that WDT

its PRP$

I PRP
walked VBD
down RB
to TO
it PRP
, ,
and CC
, ,
passing VBG
through IN
a DT
wicket NN
gate NN
of IN
gold NN
in IN
a DT
low JJ
wall NN
of IN
white JJ
marble NN
, ,
I PRP
entered VBD
the DT

The DT
heather NN
went VBD
right RB
up RB
to TO
the DT
city NN

edge NN
and CC
beat NN
against IN
the DT
marble JJ
wall NN
whenever WRB
the DT

blew VBD
it PRP

Lights NNS
began VBD
to TO
twinkle VB
from IN
high JJ
windows NNS

blue JJ
glass NN
as IN
I PRP
walked VBD
up RP
the DT
white JJ
street NN

beautiful JJ
copper NN
lanterns NNS

lit VBN
up RB
and CC
let VB
down RP
from IN

by IN
silver NN
chains NNS
, ,
from IN

ajar RB
came VBD
the DT
sound NN
of IN
voices NNS
singing VBG
, ,
and CC
then RB
I PRP
saw VBD
the DT
men NNS

Their PRP$
faces VBZ
were VBD
rather RB
grey JJ
than IN
black JJ

and CC
they PRP
wore VBP
beautiful JJ
robes NNS
of IN

silk NN
with IN

embroidered VBN
with IN
gold NN
and CC
some DT

copper NN
, ,
and CC
sometimes RB
pacing VBG
down RP
the DT
marble JJ
ways NNS
with IN
golden JJ
baskets NNS
hung VBP
on IN
each DT
side NN
of IN
them PRP
I PRP
saw VBD
the DT
camels NNS
of IN
which WDT
the DT
old JJ
shepherd NN
spoke NN

The DT
people NNS
had VBD
kindly RB
faces VBZ
, ,
but CC
, ,
though IN
they PRP
were VBD
evidently RB
friendly JJ
to TO
strangers NNS

I PRP
could MD
not RB

them PRP

ignorant NN

the DT

they PRP

I PRP

they PRP

When WRB
I PRP
tried VBD

them PRP
by IN

whence NN
they PRP

with IN
their PRP$

they PRP

only RB

fiercely RB
on IN

till IN

danced VBN
in IN

And CC
now RB
there EX
began VBD
appearing VBG
one CD

one CD

slipping VBG
softly RB
out IN
through IN

men NNS

in IN

They PRP

strange JJ

and CC
they PRP
played VBD
softly RB
on IN
them PRP

very RB
beautifully RB

their PRP$
queer NN

softly RB
sang VBD

weird JJ

wherever IN
that DT

And CC
far RB
off RB
in IN
the DT
heart NN
of IN
the DT
city NN
others NNS
were VBD
singing VBG
too RB
, ,
the DT
sound NN
of IN
it PRP
came VBD
to TO
me PRP
wherever IN
I PRP
roamed VBD

not RB
loud JJ
enough RB
to TO

but CC
gently RB
turning VBG
the DT

pleasant JJ

Slender NNP
carved VBD
arches NNS

as IN
delicate JJ
almost RB

crossed VBN

wherever WRB

There EX

none NN

nothing NN
ugly RB

sordid VB
so RB
far RB

I PRP
saw VBD
that IN

a DT

I PRP
wondered VBD
how WRB

how WRB

laid VBN
it PRP

whence NN
they PRP

what WP

determined VBD

next JJ

for IN
the DT
old JJ

not RB

his PRP$

( (

But CC
at IN

one CD

I PRP

so IN
I PRP

And CC
just RB
as IN
I PRP

whether IN

I PRP

a DT

Over IN

In IN

the DT

there EX

I PRP

burning VBG

It PRP

I PRP

Outside IN
the DT

still RB

the DT

a DT

five CD

Inside IN

I PRP

Neepy NNP

last JJ

That IN

the DT

emeralds NNS

A DT

recently RB
crossed VBN
the DT

be VB

Now RB
a DT
certain JJ
money-lender NN

who WP

just RB

made VBN
a DT

had VBD
divided VBN

one CD
for IN

of IN
the DT

the DT
twenty NN

that WDT

absolutely RB
essential JJ

and CC
one CD
for IN

while IN
the DT
third JJ
he PRP
banked VBD
abroad RB
, ,
partly RB
to TO
cheat VB
the DT

partly RB
because IN
it PRP

to TO
him PRP
that IN

and CC
that IN

In IN
the DT
upkeep NN

he PRP
included VBD
jewelry NN
for IN
his PRP$

and CC
so IN
it PRP
came VBD
about IN
that DT
Lord NNP
Castlenorman NNP
placed VBD

But CC
the DT

Neepy NNP
Thang NNP

I PRP

Not RB
many JJ

it PRP

for IN
where WRB
the DT

( (

On IN

Shiroora NNP
Shan NNP
grows VBZ
one CD

only RB
so RB
that IN
upon IN

if IN
anywhere RB

there RB
must MD
build VB
its PRP$

the DT
Bird NNP
of IN

Difficult NNP

Neepy NNP
Thang NNP
had VBD
come VBN
by IN
this DT

which WDT
was VBD
indeed RB
the DT

that IN
if IN
the DT

before IN
the DT
three CD

out IN
they PRP

undoubtedly RB
all DT

, ,
while IN
if IN
they PRP
hatched VBD
out RP

it PRP
would MD
be VB
a DT

When WRB
he PRP

these DT

Messrs. VB

they PRP

`` ``

At IN

When WRB

As IN

that DT

Over IN

I PRP

nor CC

it PRP
from IN

that IN
I PRP

merely RB

that WDT

to TO

I PRP
believed VBD
at IN
first JJ
that IN
he PRP
had VBD
qualms VBN
about IN
taking VBG
the DT
sailors NNS
' POS
pound NN
, ,
until IN
it PRP
dawned VBD
on IN
me PRP
that IN
he PRP
might MD
lose VB
the DT
game NN
; :
I PRP
saw VBD
that DT
possibility NN
in IN
his PRP$
face NN
, ,
not RB
on IN
the DT
board NN
, ,
for IN
the DT
game NN
had VBD
become VBN
almost RB
incomprehensible JJ
to TO
me PRP

I PRP
can MD
not RB
describe VB
my PRP$
astonishment NN

And CC
a DT
few JJ
moves NNS
later RB
Stavlokratz NNP
resigned VBD

The DT
sailors NNS
showed VBD
no DT
more JJR
elation NN
than IN
if IN
they PRP
had VBD
won VBN
some DT
game NN
with IN
greasy JJ
cards NNS
, ,
playing VBG
amongst JJ
themselves PRP

Stavlokratz NNP
asked VBD
them PRP
where WRB
they PRP
got VBD
their PRP$
opening NN
. .
`` ``
We PRP
kind NN
of IN
thought NN
of IN
it PRP

'' ''
said VBD
one CD

`` ``
It PRP
just RB
come VBN

our PRP$

'' ''
said VBD
another DT

He PRP
asked VBD
them PRP
questions NNS
about IN
the DT
ports NNS
they PRP
had VBD
touched VBN
at IN
. .
He PRP
evidently RB
thought VBD
as IN
I PRP
did VBD
myself PRP
that IN
they PRP
had VBD
learned VBN
their PRP$
extraordinary JJ
gambit NN
, ,
perhaps RB
in IN
some DT
old JJ
dependancy NN
of IN
Spain NNP
, ,
from IN
some DT
young JJ
master NN
of IN
chess NN
whose WP$
fame NN
had VBD
not RB
reached VBN
Europe NNP

He PRP
was VBD
very RB
eager JJ
to TO
find VB
out RP
who WP
this DT
man NN
could MD
be VB
, ,
for IN
neither DT
of IN
us PRP
imagined VBD
that IN
those DT
sailors NNS
had VBD
invented VBN
it PRP
, ,
nor CC
would MD
anyone NN
who WP
had VBD
seen VBN
them PRP

But CC
he PRP
got VBD
no DT
information NN
from IN
the DT
sailors NNS
. .
Stavlokratz NNP
could MD
very RB
ill VB
afford RP
the DT
loss NN
of IN
a DT
pound NN
. .
He PRP
offered VBD
to TO
play VB
them PRP
again RB
for IN
the DT
same JJ
stakes NNS
. .
The DT
sailors NNS
began VBD
to TO
set VB
up RP
the DT
white JJ
pieces NNS
. .
Stavlokratz NNP
pointed VBD
out RP
that IN
it PRP
was VBD
his PRP$
turn NN
for IN
the DT
first JJ
move NN
. .
The DT
sailors NNS
agreed VBD
but CC
continued VBD
to TO
set VB
up RP
the DT
white JJ
pieces NNS
and CC
sat NNS
with IN
the DT
white JJ
before IN
them PRP
waiting VBG
for IN
him PRP
to TO
move VB
. .
It PRP
was VBD
a DT
trivial JJ
incident NN
, ,
but CC
it PRP
revealed VBD
to TO
Stavlokratz NNP
and CC
myself PRP
that IN
none NN
of IN
these DT
sailors NNS
was VBD
aware JJ
that IN
white JJ
always RB
moves NNS
first RB
. .
Stavlokratz NNP
played VBD
them PRP
on IN
his PRP$
own JJ
opening NN
, ,
reasoning VBG
of IN
course NN
that IN
as IN
they PRP
had VBD
never RB
heard VBN
of IN
Stavlokratz NNP
they PRP
would MD
not RB
know VB
of IN
his PRP$
opening NN
; :
and CC
with IN
probably RB
a DT
very RB
good JJ
hope NN
of IN
getting VBG
back RP
his PRP$
pound NN
he PRP
played VBD
the DT
fifth JJ
variation NN
with IN
its PRP$
tricky JJ
seventh JJ
move NN
, ,
at IN
least JJS
so RB
he PRP
intended VBD
, ,
but CC
it PRP
turned VBD
to TO
a DT
variation NN
unknown IN
to TO
the DT
students NNS
of IN
Stavlokratz NNP

Throughout IN
this DT
game NN
I PRP
watched VBD
the DT
sailors NNS
closely RB
, ,
and CC
I PRP
became VBD
sure JJ
, ,
as IN
only RB
an DT
attentive JJ
watcher NN
can MD
be VB
, ,
that IN
the DT
one NN
on IN
their PRP$
left NN
, ,
Jim NNP
Bunion NNP
, ,
did VBD
not RB
even RB
know VBP
the DT

When WRB
I PRP
had VBD
made VBN
up RP
my PRP$
mind NN
about IN
this DT
I PRP
watched VBD
only RB
the DT
other JJ
two CD
, ,
Adam NNP
Bailey NNP
and CC
Bill NNP
Sloggs NNP
, ,
trying VBG
to TO
make VB

which WDT

the DT
master NN
mind NN

and CC
for IN
a DT
long JJ
while NN
I PRP
could MD
not RB

And CC
then RB
I PRP
heard VBP
Adam NNP
Bailey NNP
mutter NN
six CD
words NNS
, ,
the DT
only JJ
words NNS
I PRP
heard VBD
throughout IN
the DT
game NN
, ,
of IN
all PDT
their PRP$
consultations NNS
, ,
`` ``
No UH
, ,
him PRP
with IN
the DT

'' ''
And CC
I PRP
decided VBD
that IN
Adam NNP
Bailey NNP
did VBD
not RB
know VB
what WP
a DT
knight NN
was VBD
, ,
though IN
of IN
course NN
he PRP
might MD
have VB
been VBN
explaining VBG
things NNS
to TO
Bill NNP
Sloggs NNP
, ,
but CC
it PRP
did VBD
not RB
sound VB
like IN
that DT
; :
so CC
that IN
left JJ
Bill NNP
Sloggs NNP

I PRP
watched VBD
Bill NNP
Sloggs NNP
after IN
that DT
with IN
a DT
certain JJ
wonder NN
; :
he PRP
was VBD
no DT
more RBR
intellectual JJ
than IN
the DT
others NNS
to TO
look VB
at IN
, ,
though IN
rather RB
more RBR
forceful JJ
perhaps RB

Poor NNP
old JJ
Stavlokratz NNP
was VBD
beaten VBN
again RB

Well UH
, ,
in IN
the DT
end NN
I PRP
paid VBD
for IN
Stavlokratz NNP
, ,
and CC
tried VBD
to TO
get VB
a DT
game NN
with IN
Bill NNP
Sloggs NNP
alone RB
, ,
but CC
this DT
he PRP
would MD
not RB
agree VB
to TO
, ,
it PRP
must MD
be VB
all DT
three CD
or CC
none NN
: :
and CC
then RB
I PRP
went VBD
back RB
with IN
Stavlokratz NNP
to TO
his PRP$
lodgings NNS

He PRP
very RB
kindly RB
gave VBD
me PRP
a DT
game NN
: :
of IN
course NN
it PRP
did VBD
not RB
last JJ
long JJ
but CC
I PRP
am VBP
prouder NN
of IN
having VBG
been VBN
beaten VBN
by IN
Stavlokratz NNP
than IN
of IN
any DT
game NN
that IN
I PRP
have VBP
ever RB
won VBN

And CC
then RB
we PRP
talked VBD
for IN
an DT
hour NN
about IN
the DT
sailors NNS
, ,
and CC
neither DT
of IN
us PRP
could MD
make VB
head NN
or CC
tail NN
of IN
them PRP

I PRP
told VBD
him PRP
what WP
I PRP
had VBD
noticed VBN
about IN
Jim NNP
Bunion NNP
and CC
Adam NNP
Bailey NNP
, ,
and CC
he PRP
agreed VBD
with IN
me PRP
that WDT
Bill NNP
Sloggs NNP
was VBD
the DT
man NN
, ,
though RB
as IN
to TO
how WRB
he PRP
had VBD
come VBN
by IN
that DT
gambit NN
or CC
that DT
variation NN
of IN
Stavlokratz NNP
's POS
own JJ
opening NN
he PRP
had VBD
no DT
theory NN

I PRP
had VBD
the DT
sailors NNS
' POS
address NN
which WDT
was VBD
that DT
tavern JJ
as RB
much JJ
as IN
anywhere RB
, ,
and CC
they PRP
were VBD
to TO

there RB
all DT
evening NN

As IN
evening VBG
drew NN
in IN
I PRP
went VBD
back RB
to TO
the DT
tavern NN
, ,
and CC
found VBD
there EX
still RB
the DT
three CD
sailors NNS

And CC
I PRP
offered VBD
Bill NNP
Sloggs NNP
two CD
pounds NNS
for IN
a DT
game NN
with IN
him PRP
alone RB
and CC
he PRP
refused VBD
, ,
but CC
in IN
the DT
end NN
he PRP
played VBD
me PRP
for IN
a DT
drink NN

And CC
then RB
I PRP
found VBD
that IN
he PRP
had VBD
not RB
heard VBN
of IN
the DT
`` ``

'' ''
rule NN
, ,
and CC
believed VBD
that IN
the DT
fact NN
of IN
checking VBG
the DT
king NN
prevented VBD
him PRP
from IN
castling VBG
, ,
and CC
did VBD
not RB
know VB
that IN
a DT

can MD
have VB
two CD
or CC
more JJR
queens NNS
on IN
the DT
board NN
at IN

time NN
if IN
he PRP
queens VBZ
his PRP$
pawns NN
, ,
or CC
that IN
a DT

could MD
ever RB
become VB
a DT

; :
and CC
he PRP
made VBD
as IN
many JJ
of IN
the DT
stock NN
mistakes NNS
as IN
he PRP
had VBD
time NN
for IN
in IN
a DT
short JJ
game NN
, ,
which WDT
I PRP
won VBD

I PRP
thought VBD
that IN
I PRP
should MD
have VB
got VBN
at IN
the DT
secret JJ
then RB
, ,
but CC
his PRP$
mates NNS
who WP
had VBD
sat VBN
scowling VBG
all PDT
the DT
while NN
in IN
the DT
corner NN
came VBD
up RB
and CC
interfered VBN

It PRP
was VBD
a DT
breach NN
of IN
their PRP$
compact NN
apparently RB
for IN
one CD
to TO
play VB
by IN
himself PRP
, ,
at IN
any DT

they PRP
seemed VBD
angry JJ

So RB
I PRP
left VBD
the DT

then RB

came VBD
back RB
again RB
next JJ
day NN

and CC
the DT
next JJ

and CC
the DT
day NN
after IN

and CC
often RB

the DT

but CC
none NN

I PRP
had VBD

Stavlokratz NNP

they PRP

I PRP

And CC
then RB
one CD
evening NN
I PRP
found VBD
Jim NNP
Bunion NNP
drunk NN

yet RB
not RB
so RB
drunk RB
as IN
he PRP
wished VBD

for IN
the DT
two CD

I PRP
gave VBD
him PRP
very RB
nearly RB
a DT
tumbler NN

what WP

in IN

at IN
Over NNP

he PRP

I PRP

some DT

them PRP
quiet JJ

and CC
later RB
on IN
in IN
the DT
evening NN
they PRP
must MD
have VB
gone VBN
out RP

but CC
Jim NNP
Bunion NNP
stayed VBD
with IN

by IN
a DT

leaning VBG

talking VBG

his PRP$

all PDT
the DT

The DT

on IN

nights NNS
in IN
November NNP

coming VBG
up RP

I PRP

They PRP

And CC
he PRP

how WRB

then RB
I PRP

unfortunately RB

It PRP

I PRP

the DT

it PRP

no DT

When WRB

the DT

that IN
that DT

he PRP

never RB

Bill NNP
Snyth NNP
at IN

in IN

in IN

for IN
Bill NNP
Snyth NNP
already RB

Bill NNP

a DT

but CC
his PRP$
soul NN

damned VBN
right RB
enough RB

so IN
he PRP

the DT

Yes UH

he PRP

there RB

it PRP
all DT

Bill NNP
Snyth NNP
in IN

the DT
candles NNS

the DT

walking NN

out IN

then RB
the DT
bargain NN
between IN

the DT

going VBG
out RB

Bill NNP

But CC
I PRP

more RBR

interrupted VB
this DT
reminiscence NN

Why WRB

they PRP
all DT

And CC
a DT
look NN

something NN
like IN

came VBD
over IN
Jim NNP
Bunion NNP

; :
and CC
at IN
first JJ
he PRP

not RB

And CC
then RB
he PRP
said VBD
to TO
me PRP
that IN
it PRP
was VBD
like IN
this DT

they PRP

not RB

that DT
crystal NN

but CC
got VBD
it PRP
as IN
their PRP$

Bill NNP
Snyth NNP

If IN
they PRP
had VBD
paid VBN
for IN
it PRP

given VBN
something NN
in IN

to TO
Bill NNP
Snyth NNP
that WDT
would MD
have VB
been VBN
all DT
right JJ

but CC
they PRP
could MD
n't RB
do VB
that DT
now RB
because IN
Bill NNP
was VBD
dead JJ

and CC
they PRP
were VBD
not RB
sure JJ
if IN
the DT
old JJ

might MD
not RB
hold VB
good JJ

And CC
Hell NNP
must MD
be VB
a DT
large JJ

lonely JJ
place NN
, ,
and CC
to TO
go VB
there RB
alone RB
must MD
be VB
bad JJ
, ,
and CC
so RB
the DT
three CD
agreed VBD
that IN
they PRP

all DT
stick VB

use VB
the DT
crystal NN
all DT
three CD

not RB
at IN
all DT

unless IN
one CD

and CC
then RB
the DT
two CD

use VB
it PRP

the DT
one NN
that WDT

gone VBN

wait VB

And CC
the DT
last JJ

would MD
take VB
the DT

him PRP

or CC
maybe RB

They PRP

they PRP

they PRP

the DT

for IN

he PRP

they PRP

they PRP

the DT

if IN

it PRP

It PRP

all DT

Bill NNP

he PRP

He PRP

perhaps RB
five CD

Bill NNP
Snyth NNP

He PRP

it PRP

This DT

these DT

I PRP
even RB

that IN

he PRP

all PDT
the DT

dark JJ

the DT

When WRB

I PRP

They PRP

Some DT
such JJ

I PRP

At IN

The DT

the DT

it PRP

Lifting VBG

there EX

Whoever WP

As IN

Two CD

grey NNS

no DT

I PRP

I PRP

then RB

there RB
to TO

up RP
his PRP$
deadly JJ

all DT

For IN

I PRP

After IN
the DT

`` ``

it PRP
is VBZ
evident JJ
that IN
Dorothy NNP

a DT
firm JJ

in IN
these DT
Oz NNP

The DT
little JJ
ones NNS
all DT

Dorothy NNP
, ,
and CC
as IN
one CD
of IN
my PRP$
small JJ
friends NNS
aptly RB
states NNS
: :
`` ``
It PRP

So RB
here RB
she PRP

innocent NN
as IN
ever RB
, ,
I PRP
hope VBP

the DT
heroine NN

another DT
strange JJ

There EX
were VBD
many JJ
requests NNS
from IN
my PRP$
little JJ
correspondents NNS
for IN
`` ``
more JJR
about IN

'' ''
It PRP
seems VBZ
the DT
jolly RB
old JJ
fellow NN
made VBD
hosts NNS
of IN
friends NNS
in IN
the DT
first JJ
Oz NNP
book NN
, ,
in IN
spite NN
of IN
the DT
fact NN
that IN
he PRP
frankly RB
acknowledged VBD
himself PRP
`` ``
a DT
humbug NN

'' ''
The DT
children NNS
had VBD
heard VBN
how WRB
he PRP
mounted VBD
into IN

in IN
a DT
balloon NN
and CC
they PRP
were VBD
all DT
waiting VBG
for IN
him PRP
to TO

So IN
what WP
could MD
I PRP
do VB
but CC
tell VB
`` ``
what WP

? .
You PRP
will MD
find VB
him PRP
in IN
these DT

, ,
just RB
the DT
same JJ
humbug NN
Wizard NNP
as IN
before RB

There EX
was VBD
one CD
thing NN
the DT
children NNS
demanded VBD
which WDT
I PRP
found VBD
it PRP
impossible JJ
to TO
do VB
in IN
this DT
present JJ
book NN
: :
they PRP
bade VBD
me PRP
introduce VB
Toto NNP
, ,
Dorothy's NNP
little JJ
black JJ
dog NN
, ,
who WP
has VBZ
many JJ
friends NNS
among IN
my PRP$
readers NNS
. .
But CC
you PRP
will MD
see VB
, ,
when WRB
you PRP
begin VBP
to TO
read VB
the DT
story NN
, ,
that IN
Toto NNP
was VBD
in IN
Kansas NNP
while IN
Dorothy NNP
was VBD
in IN
California NNP
, ,
and CC
so RB
she PRP
had VBD
to TO
start VB

her PRP

without IN
him PRP

In IN
this DT
book NN
Dorothy NNP
had VBD
to TO
take VB
her PRP$
kitten NN
with IN
her PRP$
instead RB
of IN
her PRP$
dog NN
; :
but CC
in IN
the DT
next JJ
Oz NNP

, ,
if IN
I PRP

permitted VBN
to TO
write VB
one CD

I PRP
intend VBP

about IN
Toto NNP

Princess NNP
Ozma NNP

whom WP
I PRP

much RB
as IN
my PRP$

do VBP
, ,
is VBZ
again RB
introduced VBN
in IN
this DT

so RB
are VBP
several JJ

You PRP

also RB

with IN
Jim NNP
the DT
Cab-Horse NNP

the DT
Nine NNP
Tiny NNP
Piglets NNP
, ,
and CC
Eureka NNP
, ,
the DT
Kitten NNP

I PRP

sorry RB
the DT
kitten NN
was VBD
not RB
as RB
well RB
behaved VBN
as IN
she PRP
ought MD
to TO
have VB
been VBN
; :
but CC
perhaps RB
she PRP
was VBD
n't RB
brought VBN
up RP
properly RB

Dorothy NNP
found VBD
her PRP
, ,
you PRP
see VBP
, ,
and CC
who WP
her PRP$
parents NNS
were VBD
nobody JJ
knows NNS

I PRP
believe VBP
, ,
my PRP$
dears NNS
, ,
that IN
I PRP
am VBP
the DT
proudest JJS
story-teller NN
that IN
ever RB
lived VBD

Many VB
a DT
time NN
tears NNS
of IN
pride NN
and CC
joy NN
have VBP
stood VBN
in IN
my PRP$

while IN
I PRP
read VBP
the DT
tender NN

loving VBG

appealing VBG
letters NNS
that WDT
came VBD

me PRP
in IN
almost RB
every DT

To TO

pleased VBN
you PRP

you PRP

to TO
have VB
won VBN
your PRP$
friendship NN
, ,
and CC
perhaps RB
your PRP$
love NN
, ,
through IN
my PRP$

is VBZ
to TO
my PRP$
mind NN
as IN
great JJ
an DT
achievement NN
as IN
to TO

President NNP

Indeed RB

I PRP

much RB
rather RB

your PRP$

under IN

I PRP

I PRP
try VBP

yet RB
sometimes RB
there EX

that IN

But CC

you PRP
more JJR

me PRP
for IN
the DT

Besides IN

I PRP

partly RB
yours NNS

for IN

The DT
train NN
from IN
'Frisco NNP
was VBD
very RB
late RB

It PRP
should MD
have VB
arrived VBN
at IN
Hugson NNP

Siding VBG
at IN
midnight NN
, ,
but CC
it PRP
was VBD
already RB
five CD
o'clock NNS
and CC
the DT
gray JJ
dawn NN
was VBD
breaking VBG
in IN
the DT
east NN
when WRB
the DT
little JJ
train NN
slowly RB
rumbled VBD
up RB
to TO
the DT
open JJ
shed VBD
that IN
served VBD
for IN
the DT
station-house NN

As IN
it PRP
came VBD
to TO
a DT
stop NN
the DT
conductor NN
called VBD
out RP
in IN
a DT
loud JJ
voice NN
: :
'' ''
Hugson NNP

Siding VBG

'' ''
At IN
once RB
a DT
little JJ
girl NN
rose VBD
from IN
her PRP$
seat NN
and CC
walked VBD
to TO
the DT
door NN
of IN
the DT
car NN
, ,
carrying VBG
a DT
wicker NN
suit-case NN
in IN
one CD
hand NN
and CC
a DT
round NN
bird-cage NN
covered VBD
up RP
with IN
newspapers NNS
in IN
the DT
other JJ
, ,
while IN
a DT
parasol NN
was VBD
tucked VBN
under IN
her PRP$
arm NN
. .
The DT
conductor NN
helped VBD
her PRP
off RP
the DT
car NN
and CC
then RB
the DT
engineer NN
started VBD
his PRP$
train NN
again RB
, ,
so IN
that IN
it PRP
puffed VBD
and CC
groaned VBD
and CC
moved VBD
slowly RB
away RB
up IN
the DT
track NN
. .
The DT
reason NN
he PRP
was VBD
so RB
late RB
was VBD
because IN
all DT
through IN
the DT
night NN
there EX
were VBD
times NNS
when WRB
the DT
solid JJ
earth NN
shook NN
and CC
trembled VBN
under IN
him PRP
, ,
and CC
the DT
engineer NN
was VBD
afraid JJ
that IN
at IN
any DT
moment NN
the DT
rails NNS
might MD
spread VB
apart RB
and CC
an DT
accident NN
happen NN
to TO
his PRP$
passengers NNS
. .
So RB
he PRP
moved VBD
the DT
cars NNS
slowly RB
and CC
with IN
caution NN
. .
The DT
little JJ
girl NN
stood VBD
still RB
to TO
watch VB
until IN
the DT
train NN
had VBD
disappeared VBN
around IN
a DT
curve NN
; :
then RB
she PRP
turned VBD
to TO
see VB
where WRB
she PRP
was VBD
. .
The DT
shed VBN
at IN
Hugson NNP
's POS
Siding NNP
was VBD
bare JJ
save NN
for IN
an DT
old JJ
wooden NN
bench NN
, ,
and CC
did VBD
not RB
look VB
very RB
inviting VBG
. .
As IN
she PRP
peered VBD
through IN
the DT
soft JJ
gray NN
light VBD
not RB
a DT
house NN
of IN
any DT
sort NN
was VBD
visible JJ
near IN
the DT
station NN
, ,
nor CC
was VBD
any DT
person NN
in IN
sight NN
; :
but CC
after IN
a DT
while IN
the DT
child NN
discovered VBD
a DT
horse NN
and CC
buggy NN
standing NN
near IN
a DT
group NN
of IN
trees NNS
a DT
short JJ
distance NN
away RB
. .
She PRP
walked VBD
toward IN
it PRP
and CC
found VBD
the DT
horse NN
tied VBN
to TO
a DT
tree NN
and CC
standing VBG
motionless NN
, ,
with IN
its PRP$
head NN
hanging VBG
down RP
almost RB
to TO
the DT
ground NN
. .
It PRP
was VBD
a DT
big JJ
horse NN
, ,
tall NN
and CC
bony NN
, ,
with IN
long JJ
legs NNS
and CC
large JJ
knees NNS
and CC
feet NNS
. .
She PRP
could MD
count VB
his PRP$
ribs NN
easily RB
where WRB
they PRP
showed VBD
through IN
the DT
skin NN
of IN
his PRP$
body NN
, ,
and CC
his PRP$
head NN
was VBD
long JJ
and CC
seemed VBD
altogether RB
too RB
big JJ
for IN
him PRP
, ,
as IN
if IN
it PRP
did VBD
not RB
fit VB
. .
His PRP$
tail NN
was VBD
short JJ
and CC
scraggly RB
, ,
and CC
his PRP$
harness NN
had VBD
been VBN
broken VBN
in IN
many JJ
places NNS
and CC
fastened VBN
together RB
again RB
with IN
cords NNS
and CC
bits NNS
of IN
wire NN
. .
The DT
buggy NN
seemed VBD
almost RB
new JJ
, ,
for IN
it PRP
had VBD
a DT
shiny JJ
top NN
and CC
side NN
curtains NNS
. .
Getting VBG
around RB
in IN
front NN
, ,
so IN
that IN
she PRP
could MD
look VB
inside RB
, ,
the DT
girl NN
saw VBD
a DT
boy NN
curled VBD
up RP
on IN
the DT
seat NN

fast RB
asleep NN

She PRP
set VBD
down RP
the DT
bird-cage NN
and CC
poked VBD
the DT
boy NN
with IN
her PRP$
parasol NN

Presently RB
he PRP
woke VBD
up RP

rose VBD
to TO
a DT
sitting VBG
position NN
and CC
rubbed VBD
his PRP$
eyes NNS
briskly RB

`` ``

he PRP

seeing VBG
her PRP
, ,
`` ``

Dorothy NNP

'' ''
`` ``

she PRP
answered VBD

looking VBG
gravely RB
at IN
his PRP$
tousled JJ
hair NN
and CC
blinking NN
gray JJ
eyes NNS

`` ``

`` ``

`` ``

`` ``

she PRP
said VBD

He PRP
laughed VBD
at IN
that DT
, ,
and CC
his PRP$
laugh NN
was VBD
merry NN
and CC
frank NN

Jumping VBG
out IN
of IN
the DT

he PRP
put VBD
Dorothy NNP

suit-case NN
under IN

and CC
her PRP$
bird-cage NN
on IN
the DT
floor NN
in IN

`` ``

`` ``

The DT

`` ``

Then RB
the DT

picked VBD
up RP
the DT

The DT

Dorothy NNP

just RB

that DT

all DT

`` ``

`` ``

With IN

where WRB
the DT
strange JJ

Far NNP

The DT

one CD

This DT

growing VBG

every DT

all PDT

Dorothy NNP

his PRP$

orange NN

Then RB

As RB

The DT

Before IN

Instead RB

At IN

Noticing VBG

Zeb NNP
struck VBD

The DT

Sometimes RB

The DT

dozens NNS

Several JJ

The DT

even RB

From IN

not RB

All DT

The DT
mountain NN

not RB
glass JJ

made VBD

With IN
some DT
difficulty NN

danger NN
Jim NNP
drew VBD
the DT

the DT
green JJ
lawns NN

where WRB

The DT

`` ``

`` ``

The DT

`` ``

the DT
sudden JJ

Slowly NNP

Presently RB

The DT

On IN

Zeb NNP

The DT

Here RB

The DT

He PRP

Then RB

he PRP

This DT
was VBD
no DT
easy JJ

because IN
half NN

They PRP

secure RB
enough RB

The DT

These DT

soon RB
some DT

So IN

They PRP

The DT

When WRB

the DT

`` ``

He PRP

so IN

The DT
only JJ
thing NN
that IN

The DT

The DT
first JJ
thing NN

The DT

as IN
even RB

When WRB

Ozma NNP

So IN

Ozma NNP

joyously RB
as IN
the DT
creature NN
nestled VBD

she PRP

Afterward IN
it PRP

always RB
performed VBD
his PRP$
famous JJ
trick NN
with IN
eight CD

but CC
it PRP

There EX

there RB

that WDT

`` ``

`` ``

After IN

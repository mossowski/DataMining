truly RB

right NN

Mirdath NNP

nothing NN

And CC
she PRP
bid VBD
me PRP
then RB

make VB
use NN

not RB

up RB

I PRP

indeed RB
I PRP

me PRP

truly VB
her PRP$

shine VB

mischief NN

delight NN

as IN
she PRP
named VBD
me PRP
so IN
for IN
my PRP$
amissness NN

But CC
, ,
indeed RB
, ,
she PRP
grew VBD
sober NN
in IN
a DT
moment NN
, ,
and CC
she PRP
set VBD
up RP
her PRP$
finger NN
to TO
me PRP
to TO
hush VB

as IN
that DT
she PRP
heard VBD
somewhat RB
in IN
the DT
wood NN
that WDT

all PDT

way NN
upon IN
our PRP$
right NN

And CC
, ,
indeed RB

something NN
I PRP
heard VBD
too RB
; :
for IN
there EX

surely RB
a DT
rustling NN
of IN
the DT
leaves NNS
, ,
and CC
anon VBZ
a DT
dead JJ
twig NN
crackt NN
with IN
a DT
sound NN
clear JJ

sharp JJ
in IN

stillness NN

And CC
immediately RB
there EX
came VBD
three CD
men NNS
running VBG
out IN

the DT
wood NN
at IN
me PRP

and CC
I PRP
called VBD

them PRP
sharply RB

and CC
I PRP
put VBD
the DT

my PRP$
back NN
with IN
my PRP$
left JJ
hand NN
, ,
and CC
had VBD
my PRP$
oak JJ
staff NN
ready NN
for IN

But CC
the DT
three CD
men NNS
gave VBD
out RP
no DT
word NN
of IN
reply NN
; :
but CC
ran VBD
in IN
at IN
me PRP
; :
and CC
I PRP
saw VBD
somewhat RB
of IN
the DT
gleam NN
of IN

; :
and CC
at IN
that DT
, ,
I PRP
moved VBD
very RB
glad JJ

brisk JJ
to TO
the DT
attack NN

and CC
behind IN
me PRP
there EX
went VBD
shrill NN

sweet NN
, ,
the DT
call NN
of IN
a DT
silver JJ
whistle NN
; :
for IN
the DT
Maid NNP
was VBD
whistling VBG
for IN
her PRP$
dogs NNS
; :
and CC
maybe RB
the DT
call NN
was VBD
also RB
a DT
signal NN
to TO
the DT
men-servants NNS
of IN

Yet CC
, ,
truly RB

there EX

no DT

that WDT

yet RB
to TO

for IN
the DT

then RB

instant JJ
; :
and CC
I PRP
nowise VBP
loath NN
to TO
use VB
my PRP$
strength NN
before IN

And CC
I PRP
stepped VBD
forward RB
, ,
briskly RB
, ,
as IN
I PRP
have VBP
told VBN
; :
and CC
the DT
end NN
of IN
my PRP$
staff NN
I PRP
drove VBD
into IN
the DT
body NN
of IN
the DT
left-ward JJ
man NN
, ,
so RB
that IN
he PRP
dropped VBD
like IN
a DT
dead JJ
man NN

And CC
I PRP
hit VBP
very RB
sharply RB
at IN
the DT
head NN
of IN
another DT

and CC
surely RB
crackt VB
it PRP
for IN
him PRP
; :
for IN
he PRP
made VBD
instantly RB
upon IN
the DT
earth NN

but CC
the DT
third JJ
man NN
I PRP
met VBD
with IN
my PRP$
fist NN
, ,
and CC
neither RB
had VBD
he PRP
any DT
great JJ
need NN
of IN
a DT
second JJ
blow NN

but CC
went VBD
instant JJ
to TO
join VB
his PRP$

, ,
and CC
the DT
fight NN
thus RB
to TO
have VB
ended VBN
before IN
it PRP

and CC
I PRP
laughing VBG
a DT
little JJ
with IN
a DT
proper JJ
pride NN
, ,
to TO
know VB
the DT
bewilderment NN
that IN
I PRP
perceived VBD

Lady NNP
Mirdath NNP

regarded VBD
me PRP
through IN

even RB

But CC

indeed RB

there EX

no DT

left VBD

us PRP

before IN
there EX
came VBD
bounding VBG

three CD
great JJ

that WDT

loosed VBN

and CC
she PRP
had VBD
some DT
ado NN
to TO
keep VB
the DT

off IN

and CC
I PRP
then RB
to TO
beat VB
them PRP
off RP
the DT

upon IN

earth NN

lest IN
they PRP
maul VBP
them PRP

And CC
directly RB

there EX

a DT
noise NN
of IN
men NNS
shouting VBG

the DT
light NN
of IN
lanthorns NNS
in IN

the DT
footmen NNS

in IN

even RB

when WRB

they PRP

well RB
their PRP$

had VBD
no DT

but CC

indeed RB

my PRP$
sweet JJ

the DT
most JJS

only RB
that IN

to TO
have VB
a DT

deeper JJ

And CC
the DT

asked VBD

be VB
done VBN
with IN
the DT
foot-pads NNS

seeing VBG
that IN

But CC

I PRP
left VBD

along IN

very RB
sound JJ

Now RB

how WRB

I PRP

there EX

she PRP

almost RB

no DT

Yet CC

when WRB

she PRP

full JJ

so CC
that IN

having VBG
her PRP$

to TO

when WRB
the DT
dusk NN
was VBD

I PRP
asked VBD
her PRP
why WRB
she PRP

never RB
be VB
done VBN
of IN
her PRP$
waywardness NN
; :
because IN
that IN
I PRP

to TO

and CC
, ,
instead RB

she PRP
denied VBD

And CC
, ,
at IN
that DT
, ,
she PRP
was VBD
at IN
once RB
very RB
gentle JJ

and CC
full JJ
of IN
a DT
sweet JJ

winsome JJ

and CC
surely RB

I PRP

for IN
she PRP
brought VBD
out RP
her PRP$

played VBD
me PRP
dear JJ
olden JJ

all DT

and CC
so RB
had VBD
my PRP$

her PRP$
the DT
more RBR
intent JJ

glad JJ

And CC
she PRP
saw VBD
me PRP
that IN

having VBG
her PRP$
three CD

But CC

indeed RB

I PRP
followed VBD
her PRP
afterwards NNS
, ,
very RB
silent JJ
, ,
until IN
I PRP
saw VBD
her PRP
safe JJ
into IN
the DT
Hall NNP
; :
for IN
I PRP
would MD
not RB
have VB
her PRP$
alone NN
in IN
the DT
night NN
; :
though IN
she PRP
believed VBD
that IN
I PRP

then RB
far RB
away RB
on IN

country NN

And CC
as IN
she PRP
walked VBD
with IN
her PRP
dogs NNS
, ,
one CD

another DT
would MD
run VB
back RB
to TO
me PRP

to TO

against IN
me PRP
friendly-wise JJ

but CC
I PRP
sent VBD
them PRP
off RP
again RB
very RB
quiet JJ
; :
and CC
she PRP
had VBD
no DT
knowledge NN
of IN

; :
for IN
she PRP
to TO
go VB
singing VBG
a DT
love-song JJ
quietly RB
all PDT

But CC
whether IN

I PRP

not RB

though IN

a DT
nice JJ

Now RB
, ,
on IN
the DT

I PRP
went VBD
somewhat RB
early JJ

who WP

be VB
standing VBG
in IN

talking VBG

the DT

a DT
very RB
clever-drest JJ

that WDT

a DT

about IN
him PRP

and CC
he PRP
, ,
when WRB
I PRP
approached VBD

made VBD
no DT

for IN
me PRP
through IN
the DT

; :
but CC
stood VBD
firm NN
, ,
and CC
eyed VBD
me PRP
very RB
insolent JJ
; :
so IN
that IN
I PRP
put VBD
out RP
my PRP$
hand NN
, ,
and CC
lifted VBD
him PRP
from IN
my PRP$

And CC
lo NN

the DT
Lady NNP
Mirdath NNP
turned VBD
a DT
bitterness NN
of IN

upon IN
me PRP
that WDT
gave VBD
me PRP
an DT
utter JJ
pain NN
and CC
astonishment NN
; :
so CC
that IN
I PRP
was VBD
assured VBN
in IN
a DT
moment NN
that IN
she PRP
had VBD
no DT
true JJ
love NN
for IN
me PRP
, ,
or CC
she PRP
had VBD
never RB
striven VBN
so RB
to TO
put VB
me PRP
to TO
shame VB
before IN
the DT
stranger NN
, ,
and CC
named VBD
me PRP
uncouth JJ
and CC
brutal JJ
to TO
a DT

man NN

And CC
, ,
indeed RB
, ,
you PRP
shall MD
perceive VB
how WRB
I PRP
was VBD
in IN
my PRP$
heart NN
in IN
that DT
moment NN

And CC
I PRP
saw VBD
that IN
there EX

some DT
seeming NN
of IN
justice NN
in IN
what WP
the DT
Lady NNP
Mirdath NNP
said VBD
; :
but CC
yet RB
might MD
the DT
man NN
have VBP
shown VBN
a DT
better JJR

and CC
moreover VB
Mirdath NNP
the DT
Beautiful NNP
had VBD
no DT
true JJ
call NN
to TO
shame VB
me PRP

her PRP
true JJ
friend NN

before IN
this DT
stranger NN

Yet CC
did VBD
I PRP
not RB
stop VB
to TO
argue VB
; :
but CC
bowed VBD
very RB
low JJ
to TO
the DT
Lady NNP
Mirdath NNP
; :
and CC
afterward IN
I PRP
bowed VBD
a DT
little JJ
to TO
the DT
man NN
and CC
made VBD
apology NN
; :
for IN
, ,
indeed RB

he PRP

neither RB
great JJ

and CC
I PRP
had VBD

man NN
to TO

at IN

And CC
so RB

having VBG

I PRP
turned VBD

went VBD
on IN

Now RB

I PRP

then RB

maybe RB
twenty RB
good JJ

before IN

for IN
there EX

all DT

that IN

And CC
for IN

in IN

I PRP

I PRP

for IN

truly RB

as IN
I PRP

there EX

the DT

walking VBG
just RB

she PRP

Yet CC

when WRB

she PRP

a DT

I PRP

they PRP

indeed RB

I PRP

neither CC

I PRP

Now RB

An DT

an DT

the DT

even RB

it PRP

there RB

Then RB

Now RB

so IN

there EX

in IN

there EX

beyond IN

Now RB

before IN

I PRP

And CC

Yet RB

there EX

And CC
I PRP

And CC
because IN

I PRP

the DT

Then RB
I PRP

truly VBD
it PRP

a DT

as IN

And CC
this DT

so RB

Now RB

surely RB

Yet CC

as IN

I PRP

but CC

for IN

the DT

Yet CC

And CC

then RB
the DT

the DT

And CC
after IN

I PRP

myself PRP

but CC
when WRB

lo NN

maybe RB
a DT

I PRP

Yet CC
that IN

Night NNP

you PRP

And CC
to TO

I PRP
put VBD

and CC
afterwards NNS
took VBD
the DT

And CC
the DT

Now RB

when WRB
I PRP

there RB

I PRP
was VBD
truly RB
glad JJ

that IN
there EX

because IN
that DT
I PRP

slain VBN
the DT

how WRB

it PRP

that IN

for IN

there EX

Now RB

all PDT
this DT

go VB

upon IN

And CC
I PRP

it PRP

And CC
so RB

I PRP

as IN

And CC
this DT

I PRP

and CC
presently RB
I PRP

And CC
after IN

I PRP

for IN
I PRP

And CC
I PRP

for IN

as IN

And CC
I PRP

this DT

no RB

I PRP

Then RB

I PRP

the DT

Then RB

Yet CC

But CC

this DT
I PRP

Yet CC

Yet CC

again RB

it PRP

But CC
when WRB

about IN

in IN

And CC
I PRP

there EX

And CC
I PRP

that IN

that IN

not RB

there EX

thus RB

Yet RB

the DT

Now RB

a DT

there EX

until IN

a DT

And CC
now RB
I PRP

there EX

even RB

Yet CC

for IN

the DT

Now RB

when WRB

I PRP

I PRP

there EX

I PRP

I PRP

as IN
that IN

by IN

I PRP

I PRP

Now RB
I PRP
stept VBP

for IN

Then RB

in IN

there EX

in IN

And CC
in IN

I PRP

so IN
that IN

I PRP

the DT

but CC
very RB
crude JJ

And CC
surely RB
it PRP

strange JJ
that IN

all DT

in IN

Now RB
the DT

I PRP

very RB

so RB
in IN

Then RB

for IN

I PRP

And CC
when WRB
a DT

all PDT

there EX

Now RB

for IN

I PRP

somewhere RB

Then RB
I PRP

afterward IN
I PRP

he PRP

in IN

he PRP

surely RB
I PRP

even RB

And CC
the DT

Now RB

I PRP

Now RB

Now RB

I PRP

Now RB

no DT

Now RB

indeed RB

she PRP

truly RB

it PRP

she PRP

three CD

even RB

indeed RB

I PRP

Yet CC

Now RB

yet RB

I PRP

But CC
in IN

I PRP

I PRP

neither DT

Yet CC

And CC

the DT

And CC

twelve RB

And CC
surely RB

And CC
I PRP

indeed RB

she PRP

in IN

when WRB
that DT
I PRP

surely RB

yet RB

I PRP

And CC
afterward IN
she PRP

But CC
she PRP

As IN

But CC
afterward RB
this DT

for IN
she PRP

a DT

sore JJ
memory NN

And CC
presently RB

Yet CC

I PRP

I PRP

Now RB
the DT

that WDT

in IN

this DT

then RB

Now RB

I PRP

she PRP

she PRP

I PRP

And CC
I PRP

And CC
I PRP

neither CC

because IN

I PRP

there EX

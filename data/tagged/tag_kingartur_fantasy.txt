Excalibur NNP

in IN
fact NN

One CD

these DT
tremendous JJ

Arthur NNP
pulled VBD

it PRP

This DT
showed VBD

The DT

he PRP

The DT
Knights NNP

customarily RB

Some DT

CHAPTER NNP
FOUR NNP
Allan NNP
Meets NNP
the DT
Knights NNP
From IN
the DT
first JJ
day NN
when WRB
Allan NNP
began VBD
to TO
understand VB
the DT
tales NNS
of IN
chivalry NN
and CC
knightly RB
deeds NNS
, ,
he PRP
fancied VBD
and CC
longed VBD
for IN
the DT
day NN
when WRB
he PRP
would MD
grow VB
into IN
manhood NN
and CC
by IN
the DT
same JJ
token NN
into IN
knighthood NN
. .
Then RB
would MD
he PRP
go VB
unto JJ
King NNP
Arthur NNP
on IN
some DT
Pentecost NNP
and CC
crave VBP
the DT
boon NN
of IN
serving VBG
him PRP
. .
Mayhap NNP
, ,
too RB
, ,
he PRP
would MD
through IN
brave NN
and CC
worthy JJ
deeds NNS
gain VBP
seat NN
among IN
those DT
of IN
the DT
Round NNP
Table NNP
. .
So IN
he PRP
would MD
dream VB
, ,
this DT
youth NN
with IN
eager JJ
eyes NNS
, ,
and CC
his PRP$
father NN
, ,
Sir NNP
Gaunt NNP
, ,
soon RB
came VBD
to TO
know VB
of IN
his PRP$
son NN
's POS
fancies NNS
and CC
was VBD
overly RB
proud JJ
and CC
pleased JJ
with IN
them PRP
. .
For IN
he PRP
himself PRP
had VBD
, ,
in IN
his PRP$
days NNS
, ,
been VBN
a DT
great JJ
and CC
worthy JJ
knight NN
, ,
of IN
many JJ
adventures NNS
and CC
victor NN
of IN
many JJ
an DT
onslaught NN
. .
It PRP
pleased VBD
him PRP
that IN
son NN
of IN
his PRP$
would MD
follow VB
in IN
his PRP$
footsteps NNS
. .
When WRB
Allan NNP
was VBD
fourteen JJ
, ,
Sir NNP
Gaunt NNP
proceeded VBD
to TO
Sir NNP
Percival NNP
who WP
was VBD
great JJ
friend NN
of IN
his PRP$
and CC
bespoke NN
for IN
his PRP$
son NN
the DT
place NN
of IN
page NN
. .
And CC
so RB
to TO
please VB
Sir NNP
Gaunt NNP
and CC
for IN
friendship NN
's POS
sake NN
, ,
Sir NNP
Percival NNP
gave VBD
ready JJ
consent NN
. .
Therewith NNP
, ,
he PRP
found VBD
the DT
youth NN
pleasing VBG
to TO
the DT
eye NN
and CC
of IN
a DT
great JJ
willingness NN
to TO
serve VB
. .
So RB
must MD
we PRP
return VB
to TO
Allan NNP
who WP
is VBZ
now RB
on IN
his PRP$
way NN
for IN
many JJ
an DT
hour NN
. .
As IN
he PRP
made VBD
his PRP$
way NN
, ,
he PRP
marveled VBD
that IN
he PRP
should MD
have VB
had VBN
notice VBN
brought VBN
upon IN
himself PRP
, ,
for IN
he PRP
was VBD
young JJ
and CC
diffident JJ
and CC
should MD
by IN
every DT
token NN
have VBP
escaped VBN
attention NN
in IN
these DT
his PRP$
first JJ
days NNS
at IN
court NN
. .
How WRB
would MD
his PRP$
heart NN
have VBP
grown VBN
tumultuous JJ
had VBD
he PRP
known VB
that IN
none NN
other JJ
than IN
Arthur NNP
himself PRP
had VBD
made VBN
him PRP
choice NN
. .
But CC
that IN
he PRP
was VBD
not RB
to TO
know VB
for IN
many JJ
a DT
year NN
. .
Night NNP
came VBD
on IN
and CC
the DT
boy NN
traveled VBD
far RB
. .
Yet CC
gave VBD
he PRP
no RB
thought VBD
to TO
rest VB
for IN
he PRP
knew VBD
that IN
he PRP
could MD
ill VB
afford VB
to TO
tarry VB
and CC
that IN
only RB
with IN
the DT
best JJS
of IN
fortune NN
could MD
he PRP
overtake VB
the DT
two CD
knights NNS
in IN
time NN
to TO
make VB
early JJ
return NN
. .
About IN
him PRP
the DT
woods NNS
were VBD
dark JJ
and CC
mysterious JJ

Owls NNP
hooted VBD
now RB
and CC
then RB
and CC
other JJ
sounds NNS
of IN
the DT
night NN
there EX
were VBD
, ,
yet CC
was VBD
the DT
boy NN
so RB
filled VBN
with IN
urge NN
of IN
his PRP$
mission NN
that IN
he PRP
found VBD
not RB
time NN
to TO
think VB
of IN
ghosts NNS
nor CC
black JJ
magic NN
. .
Then RB
, ,
as IN
he PRP
turned VBD
the DT
road NN
he PRP
saw VBD
the DT
dim JJ
shadow NN
of IN
a DT
horse NN
. .
Ghostly VB
it PRP
seemed VBD
, ,
until IN
through IN
closer JJR
view NN
it PRP
proved VBD
flesh JJ
and CC
blood NN
. .
Lying VBG
close JJ
by IN
was VBD
a DT
knight NN
who WP
seemed VBD
exceeding VBG
weak JJ
and CC
sorely RB
wounded VBD
. .
Quick NN
from IN
his PRP$
horse NN
came VBD
Allan NNP
and CC
so RB
made VBD
the DT
strange JJ
knight NN
be VB
of IN
greater JJR
comfort NN
. .
Now RB
the DT
knight NN
spoke VBD
weakly RB

`` ``

the DT

it PRP

For IN

Now RB
the DT

After IN

Then RB

No NNP

CHAPTER NN

On IN

of IN
the DT

there EX
were VBD
great JJ
feats NNS

So RB
too RB
did VBD
yeomen NNS
prove VB
their PRP$
skill NN
with IN
mace NN
and CC
clubs NNS

Foot NN
races NNS
were VBD
many JJ

And CC
constant JJ
flow NN
of IN

food NN
so RB
that IN
none NN
among IN
the DT
yeomen NNS
and CC
even RB
of IN
the DT

found VBD
aught RB

Many JJ
fools NNS
there EX

too RB

these DT
pleased JJ
all DT
mightily RB

But CC
as IN
the DT
day NN
advanced VBD

all PDT
the DT
yeomen NNS
but CC
a DT
half JJ
dozen NN
remained VBD

And CC
for IN
each DT
of IN
these DT
but CC
one CD

there EX
was VBD
high JJ

those DT

from IN
such JJ

And CC
of IN

too RB

but CC
very RB
few JJ
remained VBN
for IN
last JJ
tests NNS

For IN
the DT
one CD
yeoman NN

who WP

green JJ

there EX

none NN

A NNP
stranger NN

he PRP
kept VBD
silent JJ

yet RB

equally RB

He PRP

entered VBN
himself PRP

the DT

`` ``

And CC
Sir NNP

so RB
that IN

So NNP
Allan NNP

a DT

which WDT

the DT

Now RB

the DT

Both CC

he PRP

each DT

As IN

wood NN

neither DT

the DT

So IN

Yet CC
this DT

the DT

Soon VB
the DT

forced VBN

only RB

But CC
only RB

When WRB

For IN

When WRB

Flashed VBN

so RB
that IN

And CC
each DT

Then RB

Now RB

Sore NNP

Sir NNP

Now RB

CHAPTER NN
NINE NNP
The DT
Kitchen NNP
Boy NNP
Among IN
all PDT
those DT
who WP
came VBD
to TO
the DT
court NN
of IN
King NNP
Arthur NNP
at IN
this DT
Pentecost NNP
seeking VBG
hospitality NN
, ,
were VBD
two CD
strangers NNS
in IN

who WP
because IN
of IN
being VBG
meanly JJ
garbed NN

seeming NN
awkwardness NN
brought VBD
forth RB
the DT
mockery NN

Sir NNP

Seneschal NNP

Nor CC

Sir NNP

mean JJ
harm NN
thereby NN

for IN
he PRP

knight VBN
who WP
held VBD
no DT
villainy NN

Yet CC
was VBD
his PRP$
tongue NN
overly RB
sharp JJ
and CC
too RB
oft JJ
disposed VBD
to TO
sting VBG

mock NN

Too NNP
, ,
the DT
manner NN
of IN
their PRP$
coming NN
was VBD
strange JJ

One CD
was VBD
a DT
youth NN

handsome JJ
mien NN

Despite IN
his PRP$
ill NN

he PRP

Him NNP

our PRP$
young JJ

found VBD

very RB
weak JJ
and CC
near JJ
unto JJ
death NN

asprawl NN
on IN
the DT
green JJ
about IN
a DT
mile NN
from IN
the DT
castle NN

Thinking VBG
that IN
the DT
man NN

but CC
a DT
villain NN
, ,
he PRP
would MD
fain VB
have VB
called VBN
one CD
of IN

men-at-arms NNS
to TO
give VB
him PRP
aid NN

but CC
that IN
something NN
drew VBD
him PRP
to TO
closer VB
view NN

And CC
then RB
the DT
boy NN
felt VBD
certain JJ
that IN
this DT
was VBD
no DT
villain NN
born VBN
for IN
his PRP$
face NN
bespoke VBD
gentle JJ
breeding NN
. .
So IN
he PRP
himself PRP
hastened VBD
for IN
water NN
and CC
by IN
much JJ
use NN
of IN
it PRP
the DT
man NN
soon RB
opened VBD
his PRP$
eyes NNS
and CC
found VBD
himself PRP

So RB
he PRP
studied VBD
the DT
lad NN
as IN
he PRP
helped VBD
him PRP
to TO
greater JJR
ease NN
but CC
either CC
through IN

great JJ
weakness NN

he PRP
did VBD
not RB

`` ``

to TO

`` ``

To TO

It PRP

Allan NNP

Then RB

Twice RB

they PRP

five CD

Now RB

Sir NNP

now RB
the DT

Very RB

the DT
three CD

Three CD

Now RB

Sir NNP

Between VB

Each DT

Now RB

So IN
that IN
by IN

the DT

CHAPTER NNP

Gareth NNP

Sir NNP

Brave NNP

were VBD
the DT
days NNS
that WDT

Many JJ
days NNS

Eager NNP

Sir NNP

to TO

the DT
fair JJ
Dame NNP
Lyoness NNP

with IN
the DT
Knight NNP

her PRP$
oppressor NN

`` ``
Yet RB

said VBD
the DT
fair JJ
Lady NNP

`` ``
Not RB

'' ''
So RB
spoke VBD
Gareth NNP
and CC
his PRP$
two CD
friends NNS
echoed VBD
his PRP$
words NNS

Yet CC
it PRP
was VBD
not RB
until IN
the DT
second JJ
day NN
that IN
their PRP$

For IN
as IN
they PRP

there EX

a DT

He PRP
further RB
increased VBD
his PRP$
pace NN

gave VBD

Said NNP
Allan NNP

who WP

foremost RB

`` ``

'' ''
So IN
then RB
did VBD
the DT
three CD
, ,
undecided VBD
for IN
the DT
moment NN
, ,
look VB
to TO
each DT

Until IN
Breunor NNP

Noire NNP
exclaimed VBD

`` ``
Let VB

to TO

The DT
same JJ
thought NN
being VBG
in IN
the DT
mind NN
of IN
the DT
other JJ
two CD
, ,
they PRP
begged VBD
the DT
Lady NNP
Linet NNP
to TO
await VB
them PRP

hurried VBD
forward RB
to TO
this DT
, ,
their PRP$
first JJ
adventure NN

But CC
the DT
man NN
who WP
came VBD
to TO
them PRP
, ,
unknowingly RB
, ,
had VBD
misled VBN
them PRP
. .
For IN
the DT
outlaws NN
numbered VBD
more JJR
than IN
six CD
as IN
they PRP
soon RB
found VBD
out RP
. .
So RB
that IN
when WRB
they PRP
came VBD
to TO
the DT
dell NN
in IN
which WDT
the DT
thieves NNS
were VBD
lodged VBN
, ,
the DT
three CD
of IN
them PRP
together RB

there EX

forth NN

them PRP
over RP
a DT
dozen NN
ruffians NNS

each DT
carrying VBG
either CC
club NN

mace NN

Now RB
did VBD
the DT
three CD
give JJ
proof NN
of IN
their PRP$
mettle NN

Walker NNP
, ,
too RB
, ,
wielded VBD
a DT
mighty JJ
mace NN
that WDT
spelled VBD
sure JJ
death NN
on IN
any DT

the DT
thieves NNS
whom WP
it PRP
reached VBD

Right NNP
skillfully RB
, ,
as IN
if IN
they PRP
were VBD
veterans NNS
, ,
did VBD
they PRP
hold VB
their PRP$
place NN
. .
Right NNP
well RB
, ,
they PRP
withstood VBD
the DT
onslaught NN
of IN
the DT
outlaws NN
and CC
even RB
pressed VBD
them PRP
back RP
in IN
defense NN
. .
A DT
number NN
of IN
the DT
foe NN
had VBD
fallen VBN
and CC
others NNS
uncertain RB
made VBD
as IN
if IN
to TO
flee VB

But CC
they PRP
could MD
not RB
go VB
far RB
, ,
for IN
the DT
conquerers NNS
, ,
mounted VBD

overtook VB
them PRP

So RB
that IN
there EX
was VBD
nothing NN
left NN
for IN
them PRP
to TO
do VB
but CC
to TO
turn VB
with IN
their PRP$
backs NNS
to TO
a DT
nearby JJ
wall NN
and CC
make VB
a DT
last JJ
stand NN
. .
Now RB
there EX
were VBD
but CC
four CD
of IN
these DT
ruffians NNS
left VBD
and CC
these DT
threw VBD
their PRP$
arms NNS
from IN
them PRP
and CC
pleaded VBD
mercy NN
. .
And CC
our PRP$
youths NNS
took VBD
heed NN
of IN
their PRP$
plea NN
and CC
permitted VBD
them PRP
to TO
escape VB

They PRP
made VBD
rescue NN
of IN
the DT
imprisoned JJ
knight NN
who WP
marveled VBD
much RB
, ,
after IN
his PRP$
first JJ
expression NN
of IN
gratitude NN
, ,
how WRB
so RB
youthful JJ
a DT
trio NN
could MD
have VB
overcome VBN
the DT
large JJ
number NN
of IN
outlaws NNS

Then RB
did VBD
he PRP
give VB
further JJ
proof NN
of IN
his PRP$
appreciation NN
in IN
that DT
he PRP
begged VBD
of IN
them PRP
that IN
they PRP

their PRP$

for IN
that DT
night NN
and CC
he PRP
promised VBD
them PRP
food NN
in IN
plenty NN
and CC
goodly RB
lodging JJ

Though IN
they PRP
were VBD
of IN
mind NN
to TO
accept VB
they PRP
first RB
besought VBD
the DT
wishes NNS
of IN
the DT
Lady NNP
Linet NNP
and CC
she PRP
, ,
they PRP
found VBD
, ,
was VBD
not RB
opposed VBN
thereto NN

Right NNP
well RB
did VBD
they PRP
sup VB
then RB
and CC
made VBD
themselves PRP
find VB
comfort NN
before IN
the DT
great JJ
fire NN
which WDT
blazed VBD
merrily RB

As IN
the DT
night NN
went VBD
by IN
, ,
they PRP
talked VBD
of IN
many JJ
things NNS
and CC
found VBD
their PRP$
host NN
full JJ

gone VBN

The DT
next JJ

found VBD

Many JJ
days NNS
they PRP

Other JJ
adventures NNS
befell VBP
them PRP
and CC
in IN
each DT
they PRP
accredited VBD
themselves PRP
right RB
well RB

On IN
one CD
of IN
these DT
days NNS

Breunor NNP
le NN
Noire NNP
who WP

speeded VBN
ahead RB
so RB
that IN
he PRP
was VBD
an DT
hour NN

journey NN
before IN
them PRP

a DT

For IN
as IN

there EX

an DT

many JJ

the DT

of IN
these DT
was VBD
none NN
other JJ

Sir NNP
Brian NNP

So RB
as IN
Sir NNP

him PRP
he PRP

`` ``

But CC
this DT
they PRP

quite RB
so RB
easy JJ

Well RB
did VBD
the DT
youth NN
oppose VBP
them PRP

many JJ

Until IN
there EX

ready JJ

no DT

Yet CC
did VBD
he PRP
at IN
last JJ
succumb NN
because IN
their PRP$

so RB
many JJ

And CC
then RB
did VBD
Sir NNP
Brian NNP
cast VBD
him PRP

where WRB

Sir NNP

some DT

Soon NNP
Gareth NNP

Until IN

Then RB
did VBD
the DT
three CD

And CC
as IN

it PRP
there RB
came VBD

both DT

the DT

Long RB

in IN

Now RB

the DT

forward RB

For IN

each DT
watched VBD

their PRP$

now RB

now RB
that IN

Then RB

a DT
sudden JJ

they PRP

with IN
all DT
their PRP$

And CC
well RB
it PRP

that IN

For IN
such JJ
was VBD
their PRP$
force NN
that IN

Both DT

Sir NNP

holding VBG

still RB

Sore NN
stunned VBD

each DT
for IN
many JJ
minutes NNS

Wonder VB
it PRP
was VBD
that IN
neck NN

either DT

Now RB
the DT
two CD
left VBD
their PRP$

they PRP

And CC
they PRP
fought VBD
until IN
midday NN

both DT

So CC
that IN
each DT

forced VBN

From IN
their PRP$

the DT
two CD

watched VBD
the DT

Both DT

them PRP
prayed VBP

But CC
the DT
Red NNP
Knight NNP
watching VBG
them PRP

seeing VBG
how WRB
in IN
especial JJ
Dame NNP

was VBD
interested JJ

conceived VBD
a DT

idea NN

`` ``
I PRP

So IN
he PRP

They PRP

all DT

the DT
afternoon NN

Now RB
one CD

the DT

now RB
the DT

Then RB
did VBD
they PRP
rest VB
again RB

Breunor NNP

Allan NNP
brought VBD
water NN

that IN

his PRP$

They PRP
rested VBD
for IN
a DT
half JJ
hour NN

then RB
battled VBD
once RB
again RB

Now RB
the DT
younger JJR
knight NN
seemed VBD
weaker JJR

The DT
Red NNP
Knight NNP
pressed VBD
him PRP
hard RB
as IN
he PRP

this DT

Things NNS
began VBD

look VB
dark NN
for IN

She PRP

saw VBD

And CC
coming VBG
far RB

she PRP
called VBD
out RP

`` ``

And CC
as IN

there EX

a DT

eager JJ
light NN
on IN

It PRP
gave VBD

As IN

ten VBN

so RB
he PRP

Fearfully RB
he PRP

such PDT
a DT

that IN

never RB

Yet RB
even RB
as IN
his PRP$

the DT

slowly RB

so RB
weak JJ
that IN

the DT

In IN

Then RB

that IN

who WP

soon RB
thereafter RB
and CC
who WP
then RB
avenged VBD
the DT
cowardly JJ
slaying NN
of IN
his PRP$

by IN
the DT
unknown JJ
and CC
false JJ
knight NN

For IN
our PRP$
tale NN
must MD
hold VB
its PRP$
course NN
hereafter NN

The DT
boy NN
Allan NNP
had VBD
grown VBN
with IN
the DT
two CD
years NNS
that WDT

passed VBN
since IN
the DT
adventure NN
of IN
the DT
Red NNP
Knight NNP

Red NNP

He PRP
had VBD
not RB
returned VBN
to TO

King NNP
Arthur NNP
, ,
instead RB
he PRP

Walker NNP
had VBD
set VBN
out RP
on IN
journey NN
of IN
adventure NN

No DT

and CC
miss VB
journey NN
this DT
, ,
instead RB
it PRP
followed VBD
a DT
call NN
that IN
the DT
boy NN
had VBD
had VBN
, ,
a DT
call NN
which WDT
he PRP
knew VBD
meant NN
that IN
the DT
time NN
had VBD
come VBN
for IN
him PRP
to TO
begin VB
seeking VBG
the DT
Holy NNP
Grail NNP

The DT
two CD
years NNS
had VBD
been VBN
eventful JJ
ones NNS
for IN
Allan NNP

All DT
over IN
England NNP
had VBD
he PRP

his PRP$

he PRP

Walker NNP

Adventures NNS

many JJ

everywhere RB
this DT
youth NN
through IN
kindly RB
deeds NNS
and CC
brave VB
actions NNS
left VBD

behind IN
him PRP

So RB
at IN
the DT
period NN
which WDT
our PRP$
narrative NN
now RB
covers VBZ
there EX
had VBD
grown VBN
from IN
a DT
whispering VBG
into IN
a DT
more RBR

less JJR
certainty NN
and CC
belief NN
that IN
a DT

had VBD
come VBN
who WP

find VB
the DT
Holy NNP
Grail NNP
again RB
for IN
Britain NNP
and CC
so RB
add VB
honor NN
and CC

to TO
England NNP

And CC
therewith NN
there RB
was VBD
great JJ
wonderment NN
as IN
to TO
whether IN

finder NN

or CC
of IN
Arthur NNP

Pentecost NN
was VBD
but CC
a DT
few JJ
days NNS
away RB
. .
Now RB
on IN
this DT
day NN
the DT
good JJ
King NNP
Arthur NNP
with IN
Launcelot NNP
, ,
Percival NNP
and CC
Merlin NNP
, ,
the DT
wizard NN
, ,
made VBD
the DT
round NN
of IN
the DT
sieges NNS
or CC
seats NNS
of IN
the DT
Round NNP
Table NNP
, ,
each DT

which WDT

a DT

for IN
on IN
this DT
Pentecost NNP
to TO

there EX
were VBD
to TO
be VB
many JJ
new JJ
knights NNS
made VBN
and CC
place NN
must MD
be VB
found VBN
for IN
them PRP

So RB
then RB
here RB
and CC
there RB
the DT
places NNS
were VBD
assigned VBN

Now RB
they PRP
came VBD
to TO
the DT
last JJ
of IN
the DT
places NNS

`` ``
What WP

'' ''
asked VBD
the DT
King NNP

`` ``
It PRP

that IN

this DT

'' ''
`` ``
This DT

answered VBD
Merlin NNP

`` ``

Here RB

four CD

'' ''
Now RB
then RB
Sir NNP
Launcelot NNP
make VBP
quick JJ

`` ``

`` ``

So IN
Pentecost NNP
day NN
came VBD

And CC
all DT

Merlin NNP
wondered VBD
as IN
to TO
who WP
the DT
newcomer NN

who WP

Early JJ
day NN
found VBD

Early JJ

too RB

found VBD
Allan NNP

once RB
again RB

after IN

many JJ

This DT

close RB

three CD

since IN
he PRP

He PRP

he PRP

thus RB
far RB
in IN

for IN
the DT
Holy NNP

Yet CC
not RB
altogether RB
in IN

for IN
he PRP

him PRP
that IN

closer JJR

The DT

now RB
in IN

had VBD
indeed RB
developed VBN
well RB

Broad NNP
shouldered VBD

slim-waisted JJ

he PRP
gave VBD
little JJ

yet RB
Walker NNP
riding VBG
close JJ

him PRP

had VBD

Well RB
he PRP

Now RB
on IN
this DT
Pentecost NNP
day NN

Allan NNP
had VBD
returned VBN
because IN
it PRP
was VBD
wont JJ
that IN
he PRP
should MD
do VB
so RB

also RB
because IN

urged VBD
him PRP
thence NN

So RB
then RB
he PRP
entered VBD
the DT
great JJ

because IN

CHAPTER NN

The DT
Beginning NNP

A NNP

Yet CC

For IN
he PRP
felt VBD
the DT
call NN
now RB
greater JJR

more RBR
insistent JJ

Yet CC
did VBD
he PRP
somewhat VB
fret JJ
since IN
this DT

this DT
call NN
seemed VBD
to TO
lead VB
him PRP
nowhere RB

seemed VBD
only RB

`` ``

so RB
the DT

next JJ

From IN
everyone NN

King NNP

Two CD

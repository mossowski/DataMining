Whether IN

Something VBG

For IN

the DT

I PRP

my PRP$

There EX

shaking VBG
their PRP$

The DT

The DT

We PRP

The DT

suddenly RB
I PRP

in IN

I PRP

the DT

It PRP

`` ``

We PRP

a DT

But CC

I PRP

Everything NN

We PRP

The DT

The DT

the DT

The DT

the DT

howled VBD

something NN

There EX

I PRP

The DT

our PRP$

The DT

I PRP

Close NNP

I PRP

For IN

Our PRP$

It PRP

my PRP$

But CC

the DT

These DT

Yet CC

in IN

I PRP

Perhaps RB

It PRP

out IN

At IN

my PRP$

It PRP

I PRP

none NN

The DT

I PRP

I PRP

By IN
Jove NNP

I PRP

Then RB

once RB

the DT

The DT

I PRP

then RB

realizing VBG

I PRP
crept VBP

then RB
burying VBG

As IN

further JJ

I PRP

But CC
this DT

I PRP

It PRP

neither CC

the DT

it PRP

Outside IN

I PRP

It PRP

In IN

Something VBG

The DT

I PRP

Then RB
suddenly RB
the DT

: :
a DT

the DT
only JJ

Still RB

it PRP

I PRP
raised VBD

calling VBG

But CC
when WRB
I PRP

I PRP

There EX

there EX

A NNP

grey NN

down RB

Stars NNS

the DT

I PRP

Several JJ

the DT

Oh UH

Yet CC

The DT

Its PRP$

Yet CC
nowhere RB

This DT

A DT

a DT

The DT
sand NN
whirled VBD

dry JJ

I PRP

so IN

the DT

I PRP

puzzling VBG

It PRP

the DT

I PRP

the DT
wind NN
bearing NN

hot JJ

Yet CC
all PDT
the DT

my PRP$

I PRP
crossed VBD
over RB

noted VBD
how WRB

what WP

I PRP

my PRP$

Already CC

a DT

the DT

On IN

I PRP

midway RB

I PRP

From IN

Someone NN

as RB

It PRP

out RP

the DT

The DT

And CC
altogether RB
the DT

the DT

But CC
this DT

our PRP$

my PRP$

For IN

I PRP

It PRP

but CC
that IN

effected VBN
in IN

Surely RB

They PRP

Creeping VBG

the DT

But CC

the DT

I PRP
recalled VBD
the DT

the DT

upon IN
my PRP$

that WDT

I PRP
swayed VBD

in IN

finding VBG
it PRP

There EX

it PRP

Then RB
the DT

followed VBD
quickly RB

The DT
idea NN
was VBD
so RB
bizarre JJ

so RB
absurd JJ

that IN
I PRP
felt VBD
inclined VBN

But CC
the DT
laughter NN
came VBD
no DT
more RBR
readily RB
than IN
the DT

, ,
for IN
the DT
knowledge NN
that IN
my PRP$

so RB
receptive JJ
to TO
such JJ
dangerous JJ

the DT
additional JJ

The DT

me PRP

very RB

it PRP

the DT
sun NN

up RB

I PRP

I PRP

making VBG
a DT

particularly RB

I PRP

stealthily RB

My PRP$

Provided VBN

I PRP

strength NN
somehow RB

With IN

I PRP

persuade VB
myself PRP
that IN

all PDT
a DT
subjective JJ
hallucination NN

a DT

Nothing NN

I PRP
fell VBD
asleep RB
almost RB
at IN
once RB

utterly RB
exhausted VBN

still RB
in IN
dread NN
of IN

of IN

the DT

upon IN
my PRP$

that WDT

The DT

I PRP

The DT

icy NN

the DT

Bathing VBG

an DT

the DT

seemed VBD
cleansed VBN
out IN

The DT

Quite NNP

positive JJ
the DT

Great NNP

the DT

He PRP

His PRP$

He PRP

I PRP
called VBD

him PRP

louder JJR

He PRP

not RB
answer VB

but CC
I PRP
missed VBD
the DT

his PRP$
snoring NN

and CC
also RB
noticed VBD
that IN
the DT
flap NN
of IN
the DT
tent NN

down RB

This DT
was VBD
the DT
unpardonable JJ
sin NN

I PRP
crawled VBD
out RP
in IN
the DT
darkness NN
to TO
hook VB
it PRP
back RB
securely RB
, ,
and CC
it PRP
was VBD
then RB
for IN
the DT
first JJ
time NN
I PRP
realized VBD
positively RB
that IN
the DT
Swede NNP
was VBD
not RB
here RB

He PRP
had VBD
gone VBN

I PRP
dashed VBD
out RP
in IN
a DT
mad JJ
run NN
, ,
seized VBN
by IN
a DT
dreadful JJ
agitation NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
moment NN
I PRP
was VBD
out RP
I PRP
plunged VBD
into IN
a DT
sort NN
of IN
torrent NN
of IN
humming VBG
that DT
surrounded VBD
me PRP
completely RB
and CC
came VBD
out IN
of IN
every DT
quarter NN
of IN
the DT
heavens NNS
at IN
once RB

It PRP
was VBD
that IN

familiar JJ
humming NN
-- :
gone VBN
mad JJ

A DT
swarm NN
of IN
great JJ
invisible JJ
bees NNS
might MD
have VB
been VBN
about IN
me PRP
in IN
the DT
air NN

The DT
sound NN
seemed VBD
to TO
thicken VB
the DT
very RB
atmosphere RB
, ,
and CC
I PRP
felt VBD
that IN
my PRP$
lungs NNS
worked VBN
with IN
difficulty NN
. .
But CC
my PRP$
friend NN
was VBD
in IN
danger NN
, ,
and CC
I PRP
could MD
not RB
hesitate VB
. .
The DT
dawn NN
was VBD
just RB
about RB
to TO
break VB
, ,
and CC
a DT
faint JJ
whitish JJ
light NN
spread NN
upwards NNS
over IN
the DT
clouds NNS
from IN
a DT
thin JJ
strip NN
of IN
clear JJ
horizon NN

No DT
wind NN
stirred VBD

I PRP
could MD
just RB
make VB
out RP
the DT
bushes NNS
and CC
river NN
beyond IN
, ,
and CC
the DT
pale JJ
sandy NN
patches NNS

In IN
my PRP$
excitement NN
I PRP
ran VBD
frantically RB
to TO
and CC
fro VB
about IN
the DT
island NN
, ,
calling VBG
him PRP
by IN
name NN
, ,
shouting VBG
at IN
the DT
top NN
of IN
my PRP$
voice NN
the DT
first JJ
words NNS
that WDT
came VBD
into IN
my PRP$
head NN

But CC
the DT
willows NNS
smothered VBD
my PRP$
voice NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
humming NN
muffled VBD
it PRP
, ,
so IN
that IN
the DT
sound NN
only RB
traveled VBD
a DT
few JJ
feet NNS
round IN
me PRP

I PRP
plunged VBD
among IN
the DT
bushes NNS
, ,
tripping VBG
headlong NN
, ,
tumbling VBG
over IN
roots NNS
, ,
and CC
scraping VBG
my PRP$
face NN
as IN
I PRP
tore VBP
this DT
way NN
and CC
that IN
among IN
the DT
preventing NN
branches NNS
. .
Then RB
, ,
quite RB
unexpectedly RB
, ,
I PRP
came VBD
out RP
upon IN
the DT
island NN
's POS
point NN
and CC
saw VBD
a DT
dark JJ
figure NN
outlined VBN
between IN
the DT
water NN
and CC
the DT
sky NN
. .
It PRP
was VBD
the DT
Swede NNP

And CC
already RB
he PRP
had VBD
one CD
foot NN
in IN
the DT
river NN
! .
A DT
moment NN
more JJR
and CC
he PRP
would MD
have VB
taken VBN
the DT
plunge NN

I PRP
threw VBD
myself PRP
upon IN
him PRP
, ,
flinging VBG
my PRP$
arms NNS
about IN
his PRP$
waist NN
and CC
dragging VBG
him PRP
shorewards NNS
with IN
all DT
my PRP$
strength NN

Of IN
course NN
he PRP
struggled VBD
furiously RB
, ,
making VBG
a DT
noise NN
all PDT
the DT
time NN
just RB
like IN
that DT
cursed VBD
humming NN
, ,
and CC
using VBG
the DT
most RBS
outlandish JJ
phrases NNS
in IN
his PRP$
anger NN
about IN
`` ``

'' ''
and CC
`` ``

'' ''
and CC
God NNP
only RB
knows VBZ
what WP
more RBR
besides NNS
, ,
that IN
I PRP
tried VBD
in IN
vain NN
to TO
recall VB
afterwards NNS
, ,
but CC
which WDT
turned VBD
me PRP
sick JJ
with IN
horror NN
and CC
amazement NN
as IN
I PRP
listened VBD

But CC
in IN
the DT
end NN
I PRP
managed VBD
to TO
get VB
him PRP
into IN
the DT
comparative JJ
safety NN
of IN
the DT
tent NN
, ,
and CC
flung VBD
him PRP
breathless NN
and CC
cursing VBG
upon IN
the DT
mattress NN
where WRB
I PRP
held VBD
him PRP
until IN
the DT
fit NN
had VBD
passed VBN

I PRP
think VBP
the DT
suddenness NN
with IN
which WDT
it PRP
all DT
went VBD
and CC
he PRP
grew VBD
calm JJ
, ,
coinciding VBG
as IN
it PRP
did VBD
with IN
the DT
equally RB
abrupt JJ
cessation NN
of IN
the DT
humming NN
and CC
pattering NN
outside JJ
-- :
I PRP
think VBP
this DT
was VBD
almost RB
the DT
strangest JJS
part NN
of IN
the DT
whole JJ
business NN
perhaps RB
. .
For IN
he PRP
had VBD
just RB
opened VBN
his PRP$
eyes NNS
and CC
turned VBD
his PRP$
tired JJ
face NN
up RB
to TO
me PRP
so IN
that IN
the DT
dawn NN
threw VBD
a DT
pale JJ
light NN
upon IN
it PRP
through IN
the DT
doorway NN
, ,
and CC
said VBD
, ,
for IN
all PDT
the DT
world NN
just RB
like IN
a DT
frightened JJ
child NN
: :
'' ''
My NNP

it PRP

all DT

now RB
anyhow VBP

They PRP

'' ''
Then RB
he PRP
dropped VBD
back RP
upon IN
his PRP$
blankets NNS
and CC
went VBD
to TO
sleep VB
literally RB
under IN
my PRP$
eyes NNS

He PRP
simply RB
collapsed VBD
, ,
and CC
began VBD
to TO
snore VB
again RB
as RB
healthily RB
as IN
though IN
nothing NN
had VBD
happened VBN
and CC
he PRP
had VBD
never RB
tried VBN
to TO
offer VB
his PRP$

life NN
as IN
a DT
sacrifice NN
by IN
drowning VBG

And CC
when WRB
the DT
sunlight JJ
woke VBD
him PRP
three CD
hours NNS
later RB
-- :
hours NNS
of IN
ceaseless NN
vigil NN
for IN
me PRP
-- :
it PRP
became VBD
so RB
clear JJ
to TO
me PRP
that IN
he PRP
remembered VBD
absolutely RB
nothing NN
of IN
what WP
he PRP
had VBD
attempted VBN
to TO
do VB

that IN
I PRP
deemed VBD
it PRP
wise NN
to TO
hold VB
my PRP$
peace NN
and CC
ask VB
no DT
dangerous JJ
questions NNS

He PRP
woke VBD
naturally RB
and CC
easily RB
, ,
as IN
I PRP
have VBP
said VBD
, ,
when WRB
the DT
sun NN
was VBD
already RB
high JJ
in IN
a DT
windless NN
hot JJ
sky NN
, ,
and CC
he PRP
at IN
once RB
got VBD
up RB
and CC
set VB
about IN
the DT
preparation NN

fire NN
for IN
breakfast NN

I PRP
followed VBD
him PRP
anxiously RB
at IN
bathing NN

but CC
he PRP
did VBD
not RB
attempt VB
to TO
plunge VB
in IN
, ,
merely RB
dipping VBG
his PRP$
head NN
and CC
making VBG
some DT
remark NN
about IN
the DT
extra JJ
coldness NN
of IN
the DT
water NN

`` ``

he PRP

`` ``

'' ''
`` ``
The DT

I PRP
said VBD

He PRP
looked VBD
up RP
at IN
me PRP
quietly RB
with IN
his PRP$
normal JJ
expression NN

Evidently RB
he PRP
remembered VBD
everything NN
except IN

at IN

`` ``

he PRP

`` ``

He PRP
hesitated VBD

But CC
I PRP
knew VBD
some DT
reference NN
to TO
that DT
remark NN
he PRP
had VBD
made VBN
just RB
before IN
he PRP
fainted VBD
was VBD
in IN
his PRP$
mind NN

I PRP

determined VBN

it PRP

`` ``
Because IN

'' ''
I PRP

forcing VBG
a DT
little JJ
laugh NN

`` ``
Exactly RB

he PRP
answered VBD

`` ``

I PRP

'' ''
he PRP
finished VBD

He PRP
began VBD
to TO
look VB
curiously RB
about IN
him PRP

The DT
sunlight JJ
lay NN
in IN
hot JJ
patches NNS
on IN
the DT
sand NN

There EX
was VBD
no DT
wind NN

The DT

were VBD
motionless RB

He PRP
slowly RB
rose VBD
to TO
feet NNS

`` ``

he PRP
said VBD

`` ``
I PRP

'' ''
He PRP
started VBD
off RP
on IN
a DT
run NN
, ,
and CC
I PRP
followed VBD
him PRP

He PRP
kept VBD
to TO
the DT
banks NNS

poking VBG
with IN
a DT
stick NN
among IN
the DT
sandy NN
bays NNS

caves NNS

little JJ
back-waters NNS

myself PRP
always RB
close RB

his PRP$
heels NNS

`` ``
Ah JJ

'' ''
he PRP
exclaimed VBD
presently RB
, ,
`` ``
ah NN

'' ''
The DT
tone NN
of IN
his PRP$
voice NN
somehow RB
brought VBD
back RB
to TO
me PRP
a DT
vivid JJ
sense NN
of IN
the DT
horror NN
of IN
the DT
last JJ
twenty-four JJ
hours NNS

and CC
I PRP
hurried VBD
up RB
to TO
join VB
him PRP

He PRP
was VBD
pointing VBG
with IN
his PRP$
stick NN
at IN
a DT
large JJ
black JJ
object NN
that IN
lay VBD
half NN
in IN
the DT
water NN
and CC
half NN
on IN

sand NN

It PRP
appeared VBD

caught VBN
by IN
some DT
twisted JJ
willow JJ
roots NNS
so RB
that IN
the DT
river NN
could MD
not RB

A DT
few JJ
hours NNS
before IN
the DT

`` ``

he PRP

`` ``

And CC
when WRB
I PRP
peered VBD
across IN
his PRP$
shoulder NN
I PRP
saw VBD
that IN
his PRP$
stick NN
rested VBD
on IN
the DT
body NN
of IN
a DT
man NN

He PRP
turned VBD
it PRP
over RP

It PRP

the DT
corpse NN

peasant NN

the DT

Clearly RB
the DT

but CC
a DT
few JJ
hours NNS

his PRP$

somewhere RB
about IN
the DT
hour NN

at IN

the DT

`` ``

`` ``
I PRP

I PRP

I PRP
shuddered VBD
a DT
little JJ
in IN

for IN
there EX
was VBD
something NN
about IN
the DT
appearance NN
of IN
that DT
poor JJ

that WDT
turned VBD
me PRP
cold JJ

The DT
Swede NNP
glanced VBD
up RP
sharply RB
at IN
me PRP
, ,
an DT
undecipherable JJ
expression NN
on IN
his PRP$
face NN
, ,
and CC
began VBD
clambering VBG
down RP
the DT
bank NN

I PRP
followed VBD
him PRP
more RBR
leisurely RB

The DT
current JJ
, ,
I PRP
noticed VBD

had VBD
torn VBN
away RB
much JJ
of IN

from IN

so IN
that IN
the DT
neck NN

Halfway NNP
down IN
the DT
bank NN
my PRP$

suddenly RB

held VBD
up RP
his PRP$

in IN
warning NN

but CC
either DT
my PRP$
foot NN
slipped VBD

or CC
I PRP
had VBD
gained VBN
too RB
much JJ
momentum NN
to TO

myself PRP
quickly RB
to TO
a DT

for IN
I PRP
bumped VBD
into IN
him PRP
and CC
sent VBD
him PRP
forward RB
with IN
a DT
sort NN
of IN

to TO

We PRP
tumbled VBD
together RB
on IN
to TO
the DT
hard JJ
sand NN
so IN
that IN
our PRP$
feet NNS
splashed VBN
into IN
the DT
water NN

And CC
, ,
before IN
anything NN

be VB
done VBN
, ,
we PRP
had VBD
collided VBN
a DT
little JJ

The DT
Swede NNP
uttered VBD
a DT
sharp JJ

And CC
I PRP
sprang VBP
back RB
as IN

At IN
the DT
moment NN
we PRP

the DT

there RB

from IN
its PRP$

the DT
loud JJ
sound NN

the DT
sound NN
of IN
several JJ

which WDT

with IN
a DT

as IN

things NNS
in IN

fainter NN
till NN
they PRP
finally RB
ceased VBD
in IN

distance NN

It PRP
was VBD
exactly RB
as IN
though IN
we PRP
had VBD
disturbed VBN
some DT

invisible JJ

My PRP$

clutched VBD
me PRP

I PRP

I PRP
clutched VBD
him PRP

but CC
before IN
either DT

time NN
properly RB
to TO

the DT
unexpected JJ
shock NN

we PRP
saw VBD
that IN
a DT

turning VBG

so IN
that IN
it PRP

A DT

In IN

The DT

something NN
I PRP

`` ``

then RB

I PRP

For IN

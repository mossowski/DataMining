Dare NNP
I PRP

that IN
I PRP

republican JJ
service NN

done VBN
the DT
incredible JJ
things NNS
here RB

out RP
for IN
the DT
love NN
of IN
a DT
woman NN
-- :
for IN
a DT
chimera NN
in IN
female JJ
shape NN
; :
for IN
a DT
pale NN
, ,
vapid JJ
ghost NN
of IN
woman-loveliness NN

At IN
times NNS
I PRP
tell VBP
myself PRP
I PRP

not RB
: :
that IN
you PRP

laugh VB
, ,

cast VBD

aside RP
as IN

and CC
then RB
again RB
I PRP

up RP
my PRP$
pen NN
and CC

the DT
scattered JJ
pages NNS
, ,
for IN
I PRP

it PRP
-- :
the DT
pallid JJ
splendour NN
of IN
that DT
thing NN
I PRP
loved VBD

won VBD
, ,
and CC
lost VBN
is VBZ
ever RB
before IN
me PRP
, ,
and CC
will MD
not RB
be VB
forgotten VBN

The DT
tumult NN
of IN
the DT
struggle NN
into IN
which WDT
that DT
vision NN
led VBD
me PRP
still RB
throbs VBP
in IN
my PRP$
mind NN
, ,
the DT
soft JJ
, ,
lisping JJ
voices NNS
of IN
the DT
planet NN
I PRP
ransacked VBD
for IN
its PRP$
sake NN
and CC
the DT
roar NN
of IN
the DT
destruction NN
which WDT
followed VBD
me PRP
back RB
from IN
the DT
quest JJS
drowns NNS
all DT
other JJ
sounds NNS
in IN
my PRP$
ears NNS
! .
I PRP
must MD
and CC
will MD
write VB
-- :
it PRP
relieves VBZ
me PRP
; :
read VB
and CC
believe VB
as IN
you PRP
list VBP
. .
At IN
the DT
moment NN
this DT
story NN
commences NNS
I PRP
was VBD
thinking VBG
of IN
grilled JJ
steak NN
and CC
tomatoes NNS
-- :
steak VB
crisp NN
and CC
brown NN
on IN
both DT
sides NNS
, ,
and CC
tomatoes NNS
red VBD
as IN
a DT
setting NN
sun NN
! .
Much JJ
else IN
though IN
I PRP
have VBP
forgotten VBN
, ,
THAT NNP
fact NN
remains VBZ
as RB
clear JJ
as IN
the DT
last JJ
sight NN
of IN
a DT
well-remembered JJ
shore NN
in IN
the DT
mind NN
of IN
some DT
wave-tossed JJ
traveller NN
. .
And CC
the DT
occasion NN
which WDT
produced VBD
that IN
prosaic NN
thought NN
was VBD
a DT
night NN
well RB
calculated VBD
to TO
make VB
one CD
think NN
of IN
supper NN
and CC
fireside NN
, ,
though IN
the DT
one NN
might MD
be VB
frugal JJ
and CC
the DT
other JJ
lonely RB
, ,
and CC
as IN
I PRP
, ,
Gulliver NNP
Jones NNP

the DT
poor JJ
foresaid NN
Navy NNP
lieutenant NN
, ,
with IN
the DT
honoured JJ
stars NNS
of IN
our PRP$
Republic NNP
on IN
my PRP$
collar NN
, ,
and CC
an DT
undeserved JJ
snub NN
from IN
those DT
in IN
authority NN
rankling NN
in IN
my PRP$
heart NN
, ,
picked VBD
my PRP$
way NN
homeward NN
by IN
a DT
short JJ
cut NN
through IN
the DT
dismalness NN
of IN
a DT
New NNP
York NNP
slum NN
I PRP
longed VBD
for IN
steak NN
and CC
stout NN
, ,
slippers NNS
and CC
a DT
pipe NN
, ,
with IN
all PDT
the DT
pathetic JJ
keenness NN
of IN
a DT
troubled JJ
soul NN

It PRP
was VBD
a DT
wild JJ
, ,
black JJ
kind NN
of IN
night NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
weirdness NN
of IN
it PRP
showed VBD
up RP
as IN
I PRP
passed VBD
from IN
light JJ
to TO
light JJ
or CC
crossed VBD
the DT
mouths NNS
of IN
dim NN
alleys NNS
leading VBG
Heaven NNP

to TO
what WP
infernal JJ
dens NNS
of IN
mystery NN
and CC
crime NN
even RB
in IN
this DT
latter-day JJ
city NN
of IN
ours NNS
. .
The DT
moon NN
was VBD
up RB
as RB
far RB
as IN
the DT
church NN
steeples VBZ
; :
large JJ
vapoury NN
clouds NNS
scudding VBG
across IN
the DT
sky NN
between IN
us PRP
and CC
her PRP
, ,
and CC
a DT
strong JJ
, ,
gusty JJ
wind NN
, ,
laden JJ
with IN
big JJ
raindrops NNS
snarled VBD
angrily RB
round JJ
corners NNS
and CC
sighed VBN
in IN
the DT
parapets NNS
like IN
strange JJ
voices NNS
talking VBG
about IN
things NNS
not RB
of IN
human JJ
interest NN
. .
It PRP
made VBD
no DT
difference NN
to TO
me PRP
, ,
of IN
course NN

New NNP
York NNP
in IN
this DT
year NN
of IN
grace NN
is VBZ
not RB
the DT
place NN
for IN
the DT
supernatural JJ
be VB
the DT
time NN
never RB
so RB
fit JJ
for IN
witch-riding NN
and CC
the DT
night NN
wind NN
in IN
the DT
chimney-stacks NNS
sound NN
never RB
so RB
much JJ
like IN
the DT
last JJ
gurgling JJ
cries NNS
of IN
throttled JJ
men NNS
. .
No DT
! .
the DT
world NN
was VBD
very RB
matter-of-fact JJ
, ,
and CC
particularly RB
so RB
to TO
me PRP
, ,
a DT
poor JJ
younger JJR
son NN
with IN
five CD
dollars NNS
in IN
my PRP$
purse NN
by IN
way NN
of IN
fortune NN
, ,
a DT
packet NN
of IN
unpaid JJ
bills NNS
in IN
my PRP$
breastpocket NN
, ,
and CC
round VB
my PRP$
neck NN
a DT
locket NN
with IN
a DT
portrait NN
therein NN
of IN
that DT
dear JJ
buxom NN
, ,
freckled VBN
, ,
stub-nosed JJ
girl NN
away RB
in IN
a DT
little JJ
southern JJ
seaport NN
town NN
whom WP
I PRP
thought VBD
I PRP
loved VBD
with IN
a DT
magnificent JJ
affection NN
. .
Gods NNS
! .
I PRP
had VBD
not RB
even RB
touched VBD
the DT
fringe NN
of IN
that DT
affliction NN
. .
Thus RB
sauntering VBG
along IN
moodily RB
, ,
my PRP$
chin NN
on IN
my PRP$
chest NN
and CC
much RB
too RB
absorbed VBN
in IN
reflection NN
to TO
have VB
any DT
nice JJ
appreciation NN
of IN
what WP
was VBD
happening VBG
about IN
me PRP
, ,
I PRP
was VBD
crossing VBG
in IN
front NN
of IN
a DT
dilapidated JJ
block NN
of IN
houses NNS
, ,
dating VBG
back RB
nearly RB
to TO
the DT
time NN
of IN
the DT
Pilgrim NNP
Fathers NNS
, ,
when WRB
I PRP
had VBD
a DT
vague JJ
consciousness NN
of IN
something NN
dark JJ
suddenly RB
sweeping VBG
by IN
me PRP
-- :
a DT
thing NN
like IN
a DT
huge JJ
bat NN
, ,
or CC
a DT
solid JJ
shadow NN
, ,
if IN
such PDT
a DT
thing NN
could MD
be VB
, ,
and CC
the DT
next JJ
instant NN
there EX
was VBD
a DT
thud NN
and CC
a DT
bump NN
, ,
a DT
bump NN
again RB
, ,
a DT
half-stifled JJ
cry NN
, ,
and CC
then RB
a DT
hurried JJ
vision NN
of IN
some DT
black JJ
carpeting NN
that WDT
flapped VBD
and CC
shook VBD
as IN
though IN
all PDT
the DT
winds NNS
of IN
Eblis NNP
were VBD
in IN
its PRP$
folds NNS
, ,
and CC
then RB
apparently RB
disgorged VBN
from IN
its PRP$
inmost NN
recesses VBZ
a DT
little JJ
man NN
. .
Before IN
my PRP$
first JJ
start NN
of IN
half-amused JJ
surprise NN
was VBD
over IN
I PRP
saw VBD
him PRP
by IN
the DT
flickering VBG
lamp-light JJ
clutch NN
at IN
space NN
as IN
he PRP
tried VBD
to TO
steady VB
himself PRP
, ,
stumble VB
on IN
the DT
slippery NN
curb NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
next JJ
moment NN
go VBP
down RP
on IN
the DT
back NN
of IN
his PRP$
head NN
with IN
a DT
most RBS
ugly JJ
thud NN
. .
Now RB
I PRP
was VBD
not RB
destitute JJ
of IN
feeling NN
, ,
though IN
it PRP
had VBD
been VBN
my PRP$
lot NN
to TO
see VB
men NNS
die VB
in IN
many JJ
ways NNS
, ,
and CC
I PRP
ran VBD
over RB
to TO
that DT
motionless NN
form NN
without IN
an DT
idea NN
that IN
anything NN
but CC
an DT
ordinary JJ
accident NN
had VBD
occurred VBN
. .
There EX
he PRP
lay VBD
, ,
silent JJ
and CC
, ,
as IN
it PRP
turned VBD
out RP
afterwards NNS
, ,
dead JJ
as IN
a DT
door-nail NN
, ,
the DT
strangest JJS
old JJ
fellow NN
ever RB
eyes RB
looked VBD
upon IN
, ,
dressed VBN
in IN
shabby JJ
sorrel-coloured JJ
clothes NNS
of IN
antique NN
cut NN
, ,
with IN
a DT
long JJ
grey NN
beard NN
upon IN
his PRP$
chin NN
, ,
pent-roof JJ
eyebrows NNS
, ,
and CC
a DT
wizened JJ
complexion NN
so RB
puckered JJ
and CC
tanned VBN
by IN
exposure NN
to TO
Heaven NNP
only RB
knew VBD
what WP
weathers VBZ
that IN
it PRP
was VBD
impossible JJ
to TO
guess VB
his PRP$
nationality NN
. .
I PRP
lifted VBD
him PRP
up RP
out IN
of IN
the DT
puddle NN
of IN
black JJ
blood NN
in IN
which WDT
he PRP
was VBD
lying VBG
, ,
and CC
his PRP$
head NN
dropped VBD
back RB
over IN
my PRP$
arm NN
as IN
though IN
it PRP
had VBD
been VBN
fixed VBN
to TO
his PRP$
body NN
with IN
string VBG
alone RB
. .
There EX
was VBD
neither DT
heart-beat JJ
nor CC
breath NN
in IN
him PRP
, ,
and CC
the DT
last JJ
flicker NN
of IN
life NN
faded VBD
out IN
of IN
that DT
gaunt NN
face RB
even RB
as IN
I PRP
watched VBD
. .
It PRP
was VBD
not RB
altogether RB
a DT
pleasant JJ
situation NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
only JJ
thing NN
to TO
do VB
appeared VBN
to TO
be VB
to TO
get VB
the DT
dead JJ
man NN
into IN
proper JJ
care NN
( (
though IN
little RB
good JJ
it PRP
could MD
do VB
him PRP
now RB
! .
) )
as RB
speedily RB
as IN
possible JJ

So RB
, ,
sending VBG
a DT
chance NN
passer-by NN
into IN
the DT
main JJ
street NN
for IN
a DT
cab NN
, ,
I PRP
placed VBD
him PRP
into IN
it PRP
as RB
soon RB
as IN
it PRP
came VBD
, ,
and CC
there RB
being VBG
nobody NN
else RB
to TO
go VB
, ,
got VBD
in IN
with IN
him PRP
myself PRP
, ,
telling VBG
the DT
driver NN
at IN
the DT
same JJ
time NN
to TO
take VB
us PRP
to TO
the DT
nearest JJS
hospital NN

`` ``

asked VBD
a DT
bystander NN
just RB
as IN

driving VBG
off RP

`` ``

I PRP

somewhat RB
roughly RB

`` ``

And CC
that IN

off IN

Well NNP

I PRP

that DT
stark JJ
old JJ
traveller NN
from IN

at IN

hospital NN

as IN
a DT

sat VBN
in IN

while IN

him PRP

In IN
five CD
minutes NNS
the DT
house-surgeon NN
on IN

came VBD
in IN
to TO
see VB
me PRP

with IN
a DT

of IN
his PRP$

said VBD
briefly NN

'' ''

The DT

when WRB

But CC
the DT
strangest JJS
thing NN
about IN
that DT

its PRP$
pattern NN

It PRP
was VBD
threadbare JJ
enough RB

all DT

there RB

`` ``

When WRB

At IN

The DT

The DT

Down IN

Then RB

over IN

At IN

`` ``

As IN

At IN

That DT

Thither CC

The DT

I PRP

my PRP$

A DT

Her PRP$

On IN

Then RB

It PRP

Then RB

The DT

The DT

Probably RB

It PRP

It PRP

Then RB

He PRP

I PRP

By IN

The DT

the DT

I PRP

Looking VBG

the DT

Up IN

hopeless JJ

looking VBG

when WRB

It PRP

up RP

it PRP

there EX

so CC

Had VBD

the DT

The DT

which WDT

Some DT

The DT

I PRP

before IN

Judge NNP
then RB

Every DT

it PRP

the DT

Then RB
again RB
it PRP

that WDT

Nearer NNP

and CC
then RB
there EX

no RB

any DT

it PRP

a DT

an DT

with IN
grizzled JJ
monkey-face NN

stooping VBG
gait NN

a DT
shaggy JJ

utterly RB

who WP

It PRP

since IN

cheerfully RB
about IN

whatever WP

there EX

some DT

out IN

in IN
which WDT
I PRP

So RB
very RB
cautiously RB
I PRP
edged VBD
out RB

taking VBG
advantage NN

all PDT

possible JJ
until IN
we PRP

only RB
twenty JJ

then RB
suddenly RB
standing VBG
up RP

putting VBG

most RBS

I PRP
called VBD
out RP

'' ''
Hullo NNP

'' ''
The DT
effect NN
was VBD
electrical JJ

That DT
quaint NN
old JJ
fellow NN
sprang VBD
a DT
yard NN
into IN
air NN
as IN
though IN

had VBD
shot VBN
him PRP

Then RB
, ,
coming VBG
down RB

he PRP
stood VBD
transfixed VBN
at IN
his PRP$
full JJ

as RB

as IN

staring VBG

He PRP

so RB
funny JJ
that IN
in IN

of IN

I PRP
burst VBP
out RP
laughing NN

whereat VBP
the DT

suddenly RB
recovering VBG
his PRP$

turned VBD

set VB

This DT

I PRP

He PRP
was VBD
my PRP$
sole JJ
visible JJ
link NN
with IN
the DT
outside JJ

, ,
so RB
after IN
him PRP
I PRP
went VBD
at IN
tip-top JJ
speed NN
, ,
and CC
catching VBG
him PRP
up RP
in IN
fifty JJ
yards NNS
along IN
the DT
shingle NN
laid VBD

his PRP$
nether NN

Whereat VB
the DT
old JJ
fellow NN
stopping VBG
suddenly RB
I PRP
shot VBP
clean JJ
over IN

coming VBG
down RP

in IN
the DT

But CC
I PRP
was VBD
much RB
younger JJR

he PRP

and CC
in IN

in IN

again RB

This DT
time NN
I PRP
laid VBD
hold NN

his PRP$

and CC
the DT
moment NN
he PRP

he PRP
slipped VBD
the DT
neck-thongs NNS
and CC
left VBD
me PRP
with IN
only RB
the DT

Again IN

dodging VBG

scampering VBG

all DT

upon VB
that DT

The DT

but CC
I PRP

I PRP
made VBD
a DT

grappled VBD
him PRP

but CC
he PRP
tossed VBD
his PRP$

round NN
and CC
slipped VBD
away RB
once RB
more JJR
under IN

as IN
though IN

Then RB

After IN

the DT

no RB

stony NN
for IN

where WRB

on IN

overgrown VBN

with IN

Instead RB

my PRP$

On IN

those DT

evergreen JJ

indeed RB

As IN

An DT

turning VBG

my PRP$

My NNP

redound NN
greatly RB

In IN

we PRP

CHAPTER NN
XV VBD
The DT
dark JJ
forest NN
seemed VBD
to TO
shut VB
behind IN
as IN
I PRP
entered VBD
the DT
gateway NN
of IN
the DT
deserted JJ
Hither NNP
town NN
, ,
against IN
which WDT
my PRP$
wood-cutter NN
friend NN
had VBD
warned VBN
me PRP
, ,
while IN
inside IN
the DT
soft JJ
mist NN
hung NN
in IN
the DT
starlight NN
like IN
grey JJ
drapery NN
over IN
endless JJ
vistas NNS
of IN
ruins NNS
. .
What WP
was VBD
I PRP
to TO
do VB
? .
Without IN
all DT
was VBD
black JJ
and CC
cheerless NN
, ,
inside IN
there EX
was VBD
at IN
least JJS
shelter NN
. .
Wet NNP
and CC
cold NN
, ,
my PRP$
courage NN
was VBD
not RB
to TO
be VB
put VBN
down RP
by IN
the DT
stories NNS
of IN
a DT
silly JJ
savage NN
; :
I PRP
would MD
go VB
on IN
whatever WDT
happened VBN
. .
Besides IN
, ,
the DT
soft JJ
sound NN
of IN
crying VBG
, ,
now RB
apparently RB
all DT
about RB
, ,
seemed VBD
companionable JJ
, ,
and CC
I PRP
had VBD
heard VBN
so RB
much JJ
of IN
ghosts NNS
of IN
late JJ
, ,
the DT
sharp JJ
edge NN
of IN
fear NN
at IN
their PRP$
presence NN
was VBD
wearing VBG
off RP

So RB
in IN
I PRP
went VBD
: :
up RP
a DT
broad JJ
, ,
decayed JJ
street NN
, ,
its PRP$
flagstones NNS
heaved VBN
everywhere RB
by IN
the DT
roots NNS
of IN
gnarled JJ
trees NNS
, ,
and CC
finding VBG
nothing NN
save NN
ruin NN
, ,
tried VBD
to TO
rest VB
under IN
a DT
wall NN
. .
But CC
the DT
night NN
air NN
was VBD
chilly RB
and CC
the DT
shelter NN
poor JJ
, ,
so IN
out IN
I PRP
came VBD
again RB
, ,
with IN
the DT
wailing NN
in IN
the DT
shadows NNS
so RB
close JJ
about IN
now RB
that IN
I PRP
stopped VBD
, ,
and CC
mustering VBG
up RP
courage NN
called VBN
aloud NN
: :
'' ''
Hullo NNP

you PRP
who WP
weep VBP
there RB
in IN
the DT
dark NN

are VBP
you PRP

'' ''
And CC
after IN
a DT
minute NN
from IN
the DT

of IN
the DT
empty JJ
hearths NNS
around IN
came VBD
the DT
sad JJ
little JJ
responsive JJ
echo NN
: :
'' ''
Are VBP
you PRP
living JJ

'' ''
It PRP
was VBD
very RB
delusive JJ
and CC
unsatisfactory JJ
, ,
and CC
I PRP
was VBD
wondering VBG
what WP
to TO
do VB
next RB
when WRB
a DT
slant NN
of IN
warmer NN
wind NN
came VBD
up RP
behind IN
me PRP
under IN
the DT
mist NN
, ,
and CC
immediately RB
little JJ
tongues NNS
of IN
blue JJ
flame NN
blossomed VBD
without IN
visible JJ
cause NN
in IN
every DT
darksome NN
crevice NN
; :
pale JJ
flickers NNS
of IN
miasmic JJ
light NN
rising VBG
pallid NN
from IN
every DT
lurking NN
nook NN
and CC
corner NN
in IN
the DT
black JJ
desolation NN
as IN
though IN
a DT
thousand NN
lamps NNS
were VBD
lit VBN
by IN
unseen JJ
fingers NNS
, ,
and CC
, ,
knee FW
high JJ
, ,
floated VBN
out RP
into IN
the DT
thoroughfare NN
where WRB
they PRP
oscillated VBD
gently RB
in IN
airy JJ
grace NN
, ,
and CC
then RB
, ,
forming VBG
into IN
procession NN
, ,
began VBD
drifting VBG
before IN
the DT
tepid JJ
air NN
towards IN
the DT
city NN
centre NN
. .
At IN
once RB
I PRP
thought VBD
of IN
what WP
the DT
woodcutter NN
had VBD
seen VBN
, ,
but CC
was VBD
too RB
wet JJ
and CC
sulky JJ
by IN
this DT
time NN
to TO

The DT
fascination NN
of IN
the DT
place NN
was VBD
on IN
me PRP
, ,
and CC
dropping VBG
into IN
rear NN
of IN
the DT
march NN
, ,
I PRP
went VBD
forward RB
with IN
it PRP

By IN
this DT
time NN
the DT
wailing NN
had VBD
stopped VBN
, ,
though RB
now RB
and CC
then RB
it PRP
seemed VBD
a DT
dark JJ
form NN
moved VBN
in IN
the DT
empty JJ
doorways NNS
on IN
either DT

, ,
while IN
the DT
mist NN
, ,
parting VBG
into IN
gossamers NNS
before IN
the DT
wind NN
, ,
took VBD
marvellously RB
human JJ
forms NNS
in IN
every DT
alley NN
and CC
lane NN
we PRP
passed VBD
. .
Thus NNP
I PRP
, ,
a DT
sodden JJ
giant NN
, ,
led VBN
by IN
those DT
elfin JJ
torches NNS
, ,
paced VBD
through IN
the DT
city NN
until IN
we PRP
came VBD
to TO
an DT
open JJ
square NN
with IN
a DT
great JJ
lumber NN
of IN
ruins NNS
in IN
the DT
centre NN
all DT
marred VBN

spoiled VBN
by IN
vegetation NN
; :
and CC
here RB
the DT
lights NNS
wavered VBD
, ,
and CC
went VBD
out RP
by IN
scores NNS
and CC
hundreds NNS
, ,
just RB
as IN
the DT
petals NNS
drop NN
from IN
spent JJ
flowers NNS
, ,
while IN
it PRP
seemed VBD
, ,
though IN
it PRP
may MD
have VB
been VBN
only RB
wind NN
in IN
the DT
rank NN
grass NN
, ,
that IN
the DT
air NN
was VBD
full JJ
of IN
most JJS
plaintive JJ
sighs NNS
as IN
each DT
little JJ
lamp NN
slipped VBD
into IN

The DT
big JJ

was VBD
a DT

masonry NN

which WDT

from IN

broken JJ
pillars NNS
all DT

been VBN
a DT

once RB

I PRP
pushed VBD
in IN

but CC
it PRP
was VBD
as RB
dark JJ
as IN
Hades NNP
here RB
, ,
so RB
, ,
after IN
struggling VBG
for IN
a DT
time NN
in IN
a DT
labyrinth NN
of IN

, ,
chose VBD
a DT
sandy JJ
recess NN
, ,
with IN
some DT
dry JJ
herbage NN
by IN
way NN
of IN

in IN
a DT
corner NN

and CC
there RB
, ,
thankful JJ
at IN

for IN

my PRP$
night NN

wanderings NNS
came VBD
to TO

and CC
I PRP
coiled VBD
myself PRP
down RP

ate VB
a DT

and CC

strange JJ

I PRP
dreamed VBD
that IN

that IN

She PRP

while IN

but CC
all DT

themselves PRP

who WP

but CC
said VBD
nothing NN

and CC
when WRB

dropped VBD
out RP
one CD

leaving VBG

wonderful JJ

in IN
the DT
monotony NN
where WRB

but CC
beyond IN

nothing NN

It PRP

a DT
fine JJ
morning NN
when WRB
I PRP
woke VBD
again RB

obviously RB
broad JJ
day NN
outside IN

the DT

coming VBG
down RP

Rubbing VBG
my PRP$

sitting VBG
up RP

it PRP
took VBD

some DT

my PRP$

at IN

an DT
uneasy JJ

me PRP
that IN

somehow RB
dematerialised JJ

in IN
an DT

But CC
a DT
twinge NN

in IN
my PRP$
left JJ

a DT

which WDT

a DT

out RB

the DT

I PRP
looked VBD

It PRP
was VBD
cavernous JJ
chaos NN
on IN

: :
magnificent NN

reduced VBD

only RB

Into IN

filtered VBD
wherever WRB

it PRP

I PRP
presently RB

Twenty NNP
minutes NNS

scrambling VBG
brought VBD
me PRP

a DT

where WRB
the DT

so RB

that IN

However RB

seeing VBG

I PRP
squeezed VBD

I PRP
found VBD
myself PRP
in IN
the DT

I PRP

And CC
there EX

that IN

The DT

those DT

In IN

I PRP

that IN

It PRP

very RB

the DT

Meanwhile RB

Before IN

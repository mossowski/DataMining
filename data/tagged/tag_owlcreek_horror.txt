The DT

the DT

Midway NNP

A DT

Excepting VBG
the DT
group NN
of IN
four CD

the DT
center NN
of IN
the DT

not RB
a DT
man NN
moved VBN

The DT
company NN
faced VBD
the DT
bridge NN

staring VBG
stonily RB

motionless NN

The DT
sentinels NNS

facing VBG
the DT
banks NNS
of IN
the DT
stream NN
, ,
might MD
have VB
been VBN
statues NNS
to TO

The DT

stood VBD
with IN
folded JJ
arms NNS
, ,
silent NN
, ,
observing VBG
the DT
work NN
of IN
his PRP$
subordinates NNS
, ,
but CC
making VBG
no DT

Death NNP

a DT
dignitary NN
who WP
when WRB

comes VBZ
announced VBD

received VBN
with IN
formal JJ
manifestations NNS
of IN
respect NN

even RB
by IN
those DT
most RBS

In IN
the DT
code NN
of IN
military JJ
etiquette NN
silence NN

fixity NN
are VBP
forms NNS
of IN
deference NN

The DT
man NN
who WP
was VBD
engaged VBN
in IN
being VBG
hanged VBN
was VBD
apparently RB
about IN
thirty-five JJ
years NNS
of IN
age NN
. .
He PRP
was VBD
a DT
civilian JJ
, ,
if IN
one CD
might MD
judge VB
from IN
his PRP$
habit NN
, ,
which WDT
was VBD
that IN
of IN
a DT
planter NN
. .
His PRP$
features NNS
were VBD
good JJ
-- :
a DT
straight JJ
nose NN
, ,
firm NN
mouth NN
, ,
broad JJ
forehead NN
, ,
from IN
which WDT
his PRP$
long NN

dark JJ
hair NN
was VBD
combed VBN
straight JJ
back RB
, ,
falling VBG
behind IN
his PRP$
ears NNS
to TO
the DT
collar NN
of IN
his PRP$
well NN
fitting VBG
frock NN
coat NN

He PRP
wore VBD
a DT
moustache NN
and CC
pointed VBD
beard NN
, ,
but CC
no DT
whiskers NNS
; :
his PRP$
eyes NNS
were VBD
large JJ
and CC
dark JJ
gray NN
, ,
and CC
had VBD
a DT
kindly JJ
expression NN
which WDT
one CD
would MD
hardly RB
have VB
expected VBN
in IN
one CD
whose WP$
neck NN
was VBD
in IN
the DT
hemp NN
. .
Evidently RB
this DT
was VBD
no DT
vulgar NN
assassin NN
. .
The DT
liberal JJ
military JJ
code NN
makes VBZ
provision NN
for IN
hanging VBG
many JJ
kinds NNS
of IN
persons NNS
, ,
and CC
gentlemen NNS
are VBP
not RB
excluded VBN
. .
The DT
preparations NNS
being VBG
complete JJ
, ,
the DT
two CD
private JJ
soldiers NNS
stepped VBD
aside RB
and CC
each DT
drew VBD
away RP
the DT
plank NN
upon IN
which WDT
he PRP
had VBD
been VBN
standing VBG
. .
The DT
sergeant NN
turned VBD
to TO
the DT
captain NN
, ,
saluted VBN
and CC
placed VBN
himself PRP
immediately RB
behind IN
that DT
officer NN
, ,
who WP
in IN
turn NN
moved VBN
apart RB
one CD
pace NN
. .
These DT
movements NNS
left VBD
the DT
condemned JJ
man NN
and CC
the DT
sergeant JJ
standing NN
on IN
the DT
two CD
ends NNS
of IN
the DT
same JJ
plank NN
, ,
which WDT
spanned VBD
three CD
of IN
the DT
cross-ties NNS
of IN
the DT
bridge NN
. .
The DT
end NN
upon NN
which WDT
the DT
civilian NN
stood VBD
almost RB
, ,
but CC
not RB
quite RB
, ,
reached VBD
a DT
fourth JJ
. .
This DT
plank NN
had VBD
been VBN
held VBN
in IN
place NN
by IN
the DT
weight NN
of IN
the DT
captain NN
; :
it PRP
was VBD
now RB
held VBN
by IN
that DT
of IN
the DT
sergeant NN

At IN
a DT
signal NN
from IN
the DT
former JJ
the DT
latter NN
would MD
step VB
aside RB
, ,
the DT
plank NN
would MD
tilt VB
and CC
the DT
condemned JJ
man NN
go VBP
down RP
between IN
two CD
ties NNS
. .
The DT
arrangement NN
commended VBD
itself PRP
to TO
his PRP$
judgement NN
as IN
simple JJ
and CC
effective JJ
. .
His PRP$
face NN
had VBD
not RB
been VBN
covered VBN
nor CC
his PRP$
eyes NNS
bandaged VBD
. .
He PRP
looked VBD
a DT
moment NN
at IN
his PRP$
'' ''
unsteadfast JJ
footing NN
, ,
'' ''
then RB
let VB
his PRP$
gaze NN
wander NN
to TO
the DT
swirling JJ
water NN
of IN
the DT
stream NN
racing VBG
madly RB
beneath IN
his PRP$
feet NNS
. .
A DT
piece NN
of IN
dancing VBG
driftwood NN
caught VBD
his PRP$
attention NN
and CC
his PRP$
eyes NNS
followed VBD
it PRP
down RP
the DT
current JJ
. .
How WRB
slowly RB
it PRP
appeared VBD
to TO
move VB
! .
What WP
a DT
sluggish JJ
stream NN
! .
He PRP
closed VBD
his PRP$
eyes NNS
in IN
order NN
to TO
fix VB
his PRP$
last JJ
thoughts NNS
upon IN
his PRP$
wife NN
and CC
children NNS
. .
The DT
water NN
, ,
touched VBD
to TO
gold VB
by IN
the DT
early JJ
sun NN
, ,
the DT
brooding NN
mists NNS
under IN
the DT
banks NNS
at IN
some DT
distance NN
down RP
the DT
stream NN
, ,
the DT
fort NN
, ,
the DT
soldiers NNS
, ,
the DT
piece NN
of IN
drift NN
-- :
all DT
had VBD
distracted VBN
him PRP
. .
And CC
now RB
he PRP
became VBD
conscious JJ
of IN
a DT
new JJ
disturbance NN
. .
Striking VBG
through IN
the DT
thought NN
of IN
his PRP$
dear JJ
ones NNS
was VBD
sound NN
which WDT
he PRP
could MD
neither RB
ignore VB
nor CC
understand VB
, ,
a DT
sharp JJ
, ,
distinct JJ
, ,
metallic JJ
percussion NN
like IN
the DT
stroke NN
of IN
a DT
blacksmith NN
's POS
hammer NN
upon IN
the DT
anvil NN
; :
it PRP
had VBD
the DT
same JJ
ringing NN
quality NN

He PRP
wondered VBD
what WP
it PRP
was VBD
, ,
and CC
whether IN
immeasurably RB
distant JJ
or CC
near JJ
by IN
-- :
it PRP
seemed VBD
both DT

Its PRP$
recurrence NN
was VBD
regular JJ
, ,
but CC
as RB
slow JJ
as IN
the DT
tolling NN
of IN
a DT
death NN
knell NN

He PRP
awaited VBD
each DT
new JJ
stroke NN
with IN
impatience NN
and CC
-- :
he PRP
knew VBD
not RB
why WRB
-- :
apprehension NN
. .
The DT
intervals NNS
of IN
silence NN
grew VBD
progressively RB
longer RBR
; :
the DT
delays NNS
became VBD
maddening VBG
. .
With IN
their PRP$
greater JJR
infrequency NN
the DT
sounds NNS
increased VBD
in IN
strength NN
and CC
sharpness NN
. .
They PRP
hurt VBD
his PRP$
ear NN
like IN
the DT
thrust NN
of IN
a DT
knife NN
; :
he PRP
feared VBD
he PRP
would MD
shriek VB
. .
What WP
he PRP
heard VBD
was VBD
the DT
ticking NN
of IN
his PRP$
watch NN
. .
He PRP
unclosed VBD
his PRP$
eyes NNS
and CC
saw VBD
again RB
the DT
water NN
below IN
him PRP

`` ``
If IN
I PRP

free VB
my PRP$
hands NNS

'' ''
he PRP
thought VBD

`` ``
I PRP

throw VB

By IN

My NNP

As IN

Circumstances NNS

Meanwhile RB

No DT

One CD

A DT
strange JJ
roseate NN
light VBD
shone RB
through IN

among IN
their PRP$

the DT
wind NN
made VBN
in IN
their PRP$

the DT

He PRP

not RB

his PRP$
escape NN
-- :
he PRP
was VBD
content JJ
to TO
remain VB
in IN
that DT
enchanting VBG
spot NN
until IN
retaken VBN

A DT
whiz NN
and CC
a DT
rattle NN
of IN
grapeshot NN
among IN
the DT
branches NNS
high JJ
above IN
his PRP$
head NN
roused VBD
him PRP
from IN
his PRP$
dream NN
. .
The DT
baffled JJ
cannoneer NN
had VBD
fired VBN
him PRP
a DT
random NN
farewell NN
. .
He PRP
sprang VBD
to TO
his PRP$
feet NNS
, ,
rushed VBD
up RP
the DT
sloping NN
bank NN
, ,
and CC
plunged VBD
into IN
the DT
forest JJS
. .
All PDT
that DT
day NN
he PRP
traveled VBD
, ,
laying VBG
his PRP$
course NN
by IN
the DT
rounding NN
sun NN
. .
The DT
forest NN
seemed VBD
interminable JJ
; :
nowhere RB
did VBD
he PRP
discover VB
a DT
break NN
in IN
it PRP
, ,
not RB
even RB
a DT
woodman NN

road NN
. .
He PRP
had VBD
not RB
known VBN
that IN
he PRP
lived VBD
in IN
so RB
wild JJ
a DT
region NN
. .
There EX
was VBD
something NN
uncanny JJ
in IN
the DT
revelation NN
. .
By IN
nightfall NN
he PRP
was VBD
fatigued VBN
, ,
footsore RB
, ,
famished VBD
. .
The DT
thought NN
of IN
his PRP$
wife NN
and CC
children NNS
urged VBD
him PRP
on IN
. .
At IN
last JJ
he PRP
found VBD
a DT
road NN
which WDT
led VBD
him PRP
in IN
what WP
he PRP
knew VBD
to TO
be VB
the DT
right JJ
direction NN

It PRP
was VBD
as IN
wide JJ
and CC
straight JJ
as IN
a DT
city NN
street NN
, ,
yet CC
it PRP
seemed VBD
untraveled JJ
. .
No DT
fields NNS
bordered VBD
it PRP
, ,
no DT
dwelling NN
anywhere RB
. .
Not RB
so RB
much JJ
as IN
the DT
barking NN
of IN
a DT
dog NN
suggested VBD
human JJ
habitation NN
. .
The DT
black JJ
bodies NNS
of IN
the DT
trees NNS
formed VBD
a DT
straight JJ
wall NN
on IN
both DT
sides NNS
, ,
terminating VBG
on IN
the DT
horizon NN
in IN
a DT
point NN
, ,
like IN
a DT
diagram NN
in IN
a DT
lesson NN
in IN
perspective NN
. .
Overhead NNP
, ,
as IN
he PRP
looked VBD
up RP
through IN
this DT
rift NN
in IN
the DT
wood NN
, ,
shone NN
great JJ
golden JJ
stars NNS
looking VBG
unfamiliar JJ
and CC
grouped VBD
in IN
strange JJ

He PRP
was VBD
sure JJ
they PRP
were VBD
arranged VBN
in IN
some DT
order NN
which WDT
had VBD
a DT
secret JJ
and CC
malign JJ
significance NN
. .
The DT
wood NN
on IN
either DT
side NN
was VBD
full JJ
of IN
singular JJ
noises NNS
, ,
among IN
which WDT
-- :
once RB
, ,
twice RB
, ,
and CC
again RB
-- :
he PRP
distinctly RB
heard VBD
whispers NNS
in IN
an DT
unknown JJ
tongue NN
. .
His PRP$
neck NN
was VBD
in IN
pain NN
and CC
lifting VBG
his PRP$
hand NN
to TO
it PRP
found VBD
it PRP
horribly RB
swollen RBR

He PRP
knew VBD
that IN
it PRP
had VBD
a DT
circle NN
of IN
black JJ
where WRB
the DT
rope NN
had VBD
bruised VBN
it PRP
. .
His PRP$
eyes NNS
felt VBD
congested VBD
; :
he PRP
could MD
no RB
longer RB
close VB
them PRP
. .
His PRP$
tongue NN
was VBD
swollen VBN
with IN
thirst NN
; :
he PRP
relieved VBD
its PRP$
fever NN
by IN
thrusting VBG
it PRP
forward RB
from IN
between IN
his PRP$
teeth NN
into IN
the DT
cold JJ
air NN

How WRB
softly RB
the DT

carpeted VBN
the DT
untraveled JJ
avenue NN
-- :
he PRP
could MD
no RB

feel VB
the DT
roadway NN
beneath IN

Doubtless NNP
, ,
despite IN
his PRP$
suffering NN
, ,
he PRP
had VBD
fallen VBN
asleep RB
while IN
walking VBG
, ,
for IN
now RB
he PRP
sees VBZ
another DT
scene NN
-- :
perhaps RB
he PRP
has VBZ
merely RB
recovered VBN
from IN
a DT
delirium NN

He PRP
stands VBZ
at IN
the DT

of IN
his PRP$

All DT

left VBD
it PRP

all DT

and CC
beautiful JJ

He PRP

As IN
he PRP
pushes VBZ

the DT

passes VBZ
up RP

, ,
he PRP
sees VBZ
a DT

of IN

; :
his PRP$

, ,
looking VBG
fresh JJ
and CC
cool JJ
and CC
sweet JJ

steps NNS
down RP
from IN

him PRP

At IN
the DT
bottom NN

she PRP
stands VBZ
waiting VBG

with IN
a DT

ineffable JJ

an DT

matchless JJ
grace NN

Ah NNP
, ,
how WRB
beautiful JJ
she PRP

He PRP
springs VBZ
forwards NNS
with IN

As IN
he PRP

about IN
to TO
clasp VB
her PRP$
he PRP
feels VBZ
a DT
stunning JJ
blow NN
upon IN
the DT
back NN
of IN
the DT

; :
a DT
blinding JJ
white JJ
light NN
blazes VBZ
all DT
about IN
him PRP
with IN
a DT
sound NN
like IN
the DT
shock NN
of IN
a DT

-- :
then RB
all DT

darkness JJ

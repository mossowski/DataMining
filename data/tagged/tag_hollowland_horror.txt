Now RB

Moreover RB

when WRB

there EX

Red NNP
Harald NNP

and CC
this DT

the DT

Lady NNP

with IN

Red NNP
Harald NNP

and CC
when WRB
she PRP

in IN

two CD

being VBG
of IN
princely RB
blood NN

and CC
besides VBZ
comely RB
and CC
fierce VB

King VBG
Urrayne NNP
sent VBD

demand VB
her PRP$
in IN

And CC
I PRP
remember VBP
seeing VBG
the DT
procession NN
leaving VBG
the DT

, ,
when WRB
I PRP
was VBD
quite RB
a DT
child NN
; :
and CC
many JJ

the DT

amongst VB
them PRP
, ,
Amald NNP
, ,
my PRP$
eldest JJS
brother NN

And CC
as IN
I PRP
gazed VBD
out IN
of IN
the DT
window NN
, ,
I PRP
saw VBD
him PRP
walking VBG
by IN
the DT
side NN
of IN
her PRP$
horse NN
, ,
dressed VBN
in IN
white JJ
and CC
gold JJ
very RB
delicately RB
; :
but CC
as IN
he PRP
went VBD
it PRP
chanced VBD
that IN
he PRP
stumbled VBD
. .
Now RB
he PRP
was VBD
one CD
of IN
those DT
that WDT
held VBD
a DT
golden JJ
canopy NN
over IN
the DT
lady NN
's POS
head NN
, ,
so IN
that IN
it PRP
now RB
sunk VBZ
into IN
wrinkles NNS
, ,
and CC
the DT
lady NN
had VBD
to TO
bow VB
her PRP$
head NN
full JJ
low JJ
, ,
and CC
even RB
then RB
the DT
gold NN
brocade NN
caught NN
in IN
one CD
of IN
the DT
long JJ
slim JJ
gold NN
flowers NNS
that WDT
were VBD
wrought VBN
round NN
about IN
the DT
crown NN
she PRP
wore VBD
. .
She PRP
flushed VBD
up RB
in IN
her PRP$
rage NN
, ,
and CC
her PRP$
smooth JJ
face NN
went VBD
suddenly RB
into IN
the DT
carven JJ
wrinkles NNS
of IN
a DT
wooden JJ
water-spout NN
, ,
and CC
she PRP
caught VBD
at IN
the DT
brocade NN
with IN
her PRP$
left JJ
hand NN
, ,
and CC
pulled VBD
it PRP
away RB
furiously RB
, ,
so IN
that IN
the DT
warp NN
and CC
woof NN
were VBD
twisted VBN
out IN
of IN
their PRP$
place NN
, ,
and CC
many JJ
gold NN
threads NNS
were VBD
left VBN
dangling VBG
about IN
the DT
crown NN
; :
but CC
Swanhilda NNP
stared VBD
about IN
when WRB
she PRP
rose VBD
, ,
then RB
smote VB
my PRP$
brother NN
across IN
the DT
mouth NN
with IN
her PRP$
gilded JJ
sceptre NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
red JJ
blood NN
flowed VBD
all DT
about IN
his PRP$
garments NNS
; :
yet RB
he PRP
only RB
turned VBD
exceeding VBG
pale NN
, ,
and CC
dared VBD
say VBP
no DT
word NN
, ,
though IN
he PRP
was VBD
heir VBN
to TO
the DT

of IN
the DT
Lilies NNS
: :
but CC
my PRP$
small JJ
heart NN
swelled VBD
with IN
rage NN

and CC
I PRP
vowed VBD
revenge NN
, ,
and CC
, ,
as IN
it PRP
seems VBZ
, ,
he PRP
did VBD
too RB

So RB
when WRB
Swanhilda NNP
had VBD
been VBN
queen JJ
three CD
years NNS
, ,
she PRP
suborned VBD
many JJ
of IN
King NNP
Urrayne NNP

knights NNS
and CC
lords NNS
, ,
and CC
slew VBD
her PRP$
husband NN
as IN
he PRP
slept VBD
, ,
and CC
reigned VBD
in IN
his PRP$
stead NN
. .
And CC
her PRP$
son NN
, ,
Harald NNP
, ,
grew VBD
up RP
to TO
manhood NN
, ,
and CC
was VBD
counted VBN
a DT
strong JJ
knight NN
, ,
and CC
well RB
spoken NNS
of IN

by IN
then RB
I PRP
first RB
put VBD
on IN
my PRP$

Then RB
, ,
one CD
night NN
, ,
as IN
I PRP
lay VBD
dreaming VBG

I PRP
felt VBD
a DT
hand NN
laid NN
on IN
my PRP$

and CC
starting VBG
up RP
saw JJ
Arnald NNP
before IN
me PRP
fully RB
armed VBD

He PRP
said VBD
, ,
`` ``

'' ''
I PRP
did VBD
so RB
, ,
all DT
but CC
my PRP$

, ,
as IN
he PRP
was VBD

He PRP
kissed VBD
me PRP
on IN
the DT
forehead NN

his PRP$
lips NNS
felt VBD
hot JJ
and CC
dry JJ

and CC
when WRB
they PRP
bought VBD
torches NNS
, ,
and CC
I PRP
could MD
see VB
his PRP$
face NN
plainly RB
, ,
I PRP
saw VBD
he PRP
was VBD
very RB
pale JJ

He PRP
said VBD
: :
`` ``

I PRP

because IN
my PRP$

wicked VBN

I PRP
rejoiced VBD
exceedingly RB
at IN
the DT

so IN
that IN
I PRP

only RB

how WRB

Then RB

down RB

It PRP

the DT

I PRP

A NNP

As IN

we PRP

I PRP

The DT

we PRP

on IN

that IN

we PRP

We PRP

`` ``

So RB

as IN

they PRP

down IN

so IN
that IN
we PRP
destroyed VBD

for IN

so IN

some DT
fifteen NN

Then RB

where WRB
some DT

such JJ

These DT

so RB

There EX

For IN

so RB

And CC
we PRP

the DT

Whereupon NNP

a DT

So RB

then RB

both DT

Then RB

as IN
they PRP

I PRP

that IN

one CD

one CD

Also RB
I PRP

when WRB

still RB

the DT

I PRP

there RB

no DT

`` ``

we PRP

albeit IN

Then RB
I PRP

meanwhile RB

gave VBD

great JJ

for IN
I PRP

that IN

then RB
, ,
no DT

it PRP
again RB

God NNP
be VB
praised VBN

I PRP
tore VBD
it PRP
off RP
and CC
cast VB
it PRP
far RB
from IN
me PRP
; :
I PRP
saw VBD
the DT
earth NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
worms NNS
and CC
green JJ
weeds NNS
and CC
sun- JJ
begotten NN
slime NN
, ,
whirling VBG
out RP
from IN
it PRP
radiatingly RB
, ,
as IN
it PRP
spun VBZ
round NN
about IN

I PRP
was VBD
girt VBN
with IN
a DT
sword NN
too RB
, ,
the DT
leathern JJ
belt NN
of IN
which WDT
had VBD
shrunk NN
and CC
squeezed VBN
my PRP$
waist NN
: :
dead JJ
leaves NNS
had VBD
gathered VBN
in IN
knots NNS
about IN
the DT
buckles NNS
of IN
it PRP
, ,
the DT
gilded JJ
handle NN
was VBD
encrusted VBN
with IN
clay NN
in IN
many JJ
parts NNS
, ,
the DT
velvet NN
sheath NN
miserably RB
worn JJ

But CC
, ,
verily RB
, ,
when WRB
I PRP
took VBD
hold NN
of IN
the DT
hilt NN
, ,
and CC
pent NN
in IN
my PRP$
hand NN
; :
lo NN
! .
then RB
, ,
I PRP
drew VBD
out RP
my PRP$

true JJ
blade NN
and CC
shook VB
it PRP
flawless RB
from IN
hilt VBN
to TO
point VB
, ,
gleaming VBG
white JJ
in IN
that DT

Therefore IN
it PRP
sent VBD
a DT
thrill NN
of IN
joy NN
to TO
my PRP$
heart NN
, ,
to TO
know VB
that IN
there EX
was VBD
one CD

: :
I PRP
sheathed VBD
it PRP
again RB
carefully RB
, ,
and CC
undoing VBG
it PRP
from IN
my PRP$
waist NN
, ,
hung VBD
it PRP
about IN
my PRP$

Then RB
catching VBG
up RP
my PRP$
rags NNS
in IN
my PRP$
arms NNS
, ,
I PRP
drew VBD
them PRP
up RP
till VB
my PRP$

were VBD
altogether RB
clear JJ
from IN
them PRP
, ,
afterwards NNS
folded VBD
my PRP$

over IN
my PRP$

, ,
gave VBD
a DT
long JJ
leap NN
and CC
ran NN
, ,
looking VBG
downward JJ
, ,
but CC
not RB
giving VBG
heed NN
to TO
my PRP$
way NN

Once RB
or CC
twice RB
I PRP
fell VBD
over IN
stumps NNS
of IN
trees NNS
, ,
and CC
such- NNS
like IN
, ,
for IN
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
cut-down JJ
wood NN
that IN
I PRP
was VBD
in IN
, ,
but CC
I PRP
rose VBD
always RB
, ,
though IN
bleeding NN
and CC
confused VBN
, ,
and CC
went VBD
on IN
still RB
; :
sometimes RB
tearing VBG
madly RB
through IN
briars NNS
and CC
gorse NN
bushes NNS
, ,
so IN
that IN
my PRP$
blood NN
dropped VBD
on IN
the DT
dead JJ
leaves VBZ
as IN
I PRP
went VBD

I PRP
ran VBD
in IN
this DT
way NN
for IN
about IN
an DT
hour NN
; :
then RB
I PRP
heard VBP
a DT
gurgling NN
and CC
splashing NN
of IN
waters NNS
; :
I PRP
gave VBD
a DT
great JJ
shout NN
and CC
leapt NN
strongly RB
, ,
with IN
shut JJ
eyes NNS
, ,
and CC
the DT
black JJ
water NN
closed VBD
over IN
me PRP

When WRB
I PRP
rose VBD
again RB
, ,
I PRP
saw VBD
near IN
me PRP
a DT
boat NN
with IN
a DT
man NN
in IN
it PRP
; :
but CC
the DT
shore NN
was VBD
far RB
off IN
; :
I PRP
struck VBD
out RP
toward IN
the DT
boat NN
, ,
but CC
my PRP$
clothes NNS
which WDT
I PRP
had VBD
knotted VBN
and CC
folded VBN
about IN
me PRP
, ,
weighed VBD
me PRP
down RP
terribly RB
. .
The DT
man NN
looked VBD
at IN
me PRP
, ,
and CC
began VBD
to TO
paddle VB
toward IN
me PRP
with IN
the DT
oar NN
he PRP
held VBD
in IN
his PRP$
left JJ
hand NN
, ,
having VBG
in IN
his PRP$
right NN
a DT
long JJ
, ,
slender NN
spear NN
, ,
barbed VBN
like IN
a DT
fish-hook NN
; :
perhaps RB
, ,
I PRP
thought VBD
, ,
it PRP
is VBZ
some DT
fishing NN
spear NN
; :
moreover VB
his PRP$
raiment NN
was VBD
of IN
scarlet NN
, ,
with IN
upright JJ
stripes NNS
of IN
yellow JJ
and CC
black JJ
all DT
over IN
it PRP

When WRB
my PRP$
eye NN
caught VBD
his PRP$
, ,
a DT
smile NN
widened VBD
his PRP$
mouth NN
as IN
if IN
some DT
one CD
had VBD
made VBN
a DT
joke NN
; :
but CC
I PRP
was VBD
beginning VBG
to TO
sink VB
, ,
and CC
indeed RB
my PRP$
head NN
was VBD
almost RB
under IN
water NN
just RB
as IN
he PRP
came VBD
and CC
stood VBD
above IN
me PRP
, ,
but CC
before IN
it PRP
went VBD
quite RB
under IN
, ,
I PRP
saw VBD
his PRP$
spear JJ
gleam NN
, ,
then RB
felt VBD
it PRP
in IN
my PRP$
shoulder NN
, ,
and CC
for IN
the DT
present JJ
, ,
felt VBD
nothing NN
else RB
. .
When WRB
I PRP
woke VBD
I PRP
was VBD
on IN
the DT
bank NN
of IN
that DT
river NN
; :
the DT
flooded JJ
waters NNS
went VBD
hurrying VBG
past IN
me PRP
; :
no DT
boat NN
on IN
them PRP
now RB
; :
from IN
the DT
river NN
the DT
ground NN
went VBD
up RB
in IN
gentle JJ
slopes NNS
till IN
it PRP
grew VBD
a DT
great JJ
hill NN
, ,
and CC
there RB
, ,
on IN
that DT
hill-top JJ
, ,
Yes UH
, ,
I PRP
might MD
forget VB
many JJ
things NNS
, ,
almost RB
everything NN
, ,
but CC
not RB
that IN
, ,
not RB
the DT
old JJ
castle NN
of IN
my PRP$
fathers NNS
up RB
among IN
the DT
hills NNS
, ,
its PRP$

blackened VBN
now RB
and CC
shattered VBD
, ,
yet CC
still RB
no DT
enemy NN

banner NN
waved VBD
from IN
it PRP

So CC
I PRP
said VBD
I PRP
would MD
go VB
and CC
die VB
there RB
? .
and CC
at IN
this DT
thought NN
I PRP
drew VBD
my PRP$
sword NN
, ,
which WDT
yet RB
hung VBP
about IN
my PRP$
neck NN
, ,
and CC
shook VBD
it PRP
in IN
the DT
air NN
till VB
the DT
true JJ
steel NN
quivered VBD
, ,
then RB
began VBD
to TO
pace NN
towards IN
the DT
castle NN
. .
I PRP
was VBD
quite RB
naked JJ
, ,
no DT
rag NN
about IN
me PRP
; :
I PRP
took VBD
no DT
heed NN
of IN
that DT
only JJ
thanking NN
God NNP
that IN
my PRP$
sword NN
was VBD
left VBN
, ,
and CC
so RB
toiled VBD
up RP
the DT
hill NN
. .
I PRP
entered VBD
the DT
castle NN
soon RB
by IN
the DT
outer JJ
court NN
; :
I PRP
knew VBD
the DT
way NN
so RB
well RB
, ,
that IN
I PRP
did VBD
not RB
lift VB
my PRP$
eyes NNS
from IN
the DT
groimd NN
, ,
but CC
walked VBD
on IN
over IN
the DT
lowered JJ
drawbridge NN
through IN
the DT
unguarded JJ
gates NNS
, ,
and CC
stood VBD
in IN
the DT
great JJ
hall NN
at IN
lastmy NN
father NN

hall NN
as IN
bare NN
of IN
everything NN
but CC
my PRP$
sword NN
as IN
when WRB
I PRP
came VBD
into IN
the DT
world NN
fifty NN
years NNS
before IN
: :
I PRP
had VBD
as IN
little JJ
clothes NNS

as IN
little JJ
wealth NN
, ,
less JJR
memory NN
and CC
thought NN
, ,
I PRP
verily RB
believe VBP

than IN
then RB

So RB
I PRP
lifted VBD
up RP
my PRP$
eyes NNS
and CC
gazed VBD
; :
no DT
glass NN
in IN
the DT
windows NNS
, ,
no DT
hangings NNS
on IN
the DT
walls NNS
; :
the DT
vaulting NN
yet RB
held VBN
good JJ
throughout IN

but CC
seemed VBD
to TO
be VB
going VBG
; :
the DT
mortar NN
had VBD
fallen VBN
out RP
from IN
between IN
the DT
stones NNS
, ,
and CC
grass NN
and CC
fern JJ
grew VBD
in IN
the DT
joints NNS
; :
the DT
marble JJ
pavement NN
was VBD
in IN
some DT
places NNS
gone VBN
, ,
and CC
water NN
stood VBD
about IN
in IN
puddles NNS
, ,
though IN
one CD
scarce NN
knew VBD
how WRB
it PRP
had VBD
got VBN
there RB
. .
No UH
hangings NNS
on IN
the DT
walls- JJ
no DT
; :
yet RB
, ,
strange JJ
to TO
say VB
, ,
instead RB
of IN
them PRP
, ,
the DT
walls NNS
blazed VBN
from IN
end NN
to TO
end VB
with IN
scarlet JJ
paintings NNS
, ,
only RB
striped VBD
across IN
with IN
green JJ
damp-marks NNS
in IN
many JJ
places NNS
, ,
some DT
falling VBG
bodily RB
from IN
the DT
wall NN
, ,
the DT
plaster NN
hanging VBG
down RP
with IN
the DT
fading VBG
colour NN
on IN
it PRP

In IN
all DT
of IN
them PRP
, ,
except IN
for IN
the DT
shadows NNS
and CC
the DT
faces VBZ
of IN
the DT
figures NNS
, ,
there EX
was VBD
scarce JJ
any DT
colour NN
but CC
scarlet NN
and CC
yellow NN

Here RB
and CC
there RB
it PRP
seemed VBD
the DT
painter NN
, ,
whoever WP
it PRP
was VBD
, ,
had VBD
tried VBN
to TO
make VB
his PRP$
trees NNS
or CC
his PRP$
grass NN
green NN
, ,
but CC
it PRP
would MD
not RB
do VB
; :
some DT
ghastly RB
thoughts NNS
must MD
have VB
filled VBN
his PRP$
head NN
, ,
for IN
all PDT
the DT
green JJ
went VBD
presently RB
into IN
yellow JJ
, ,
out-sweeping JJ
through IN
the DT
picture NN
dismally RB
. .
But CC
the DT
faces VBZ
were VBD
painted VBN
to TO
the DT
very RB
life NN
, ,
or CC
it PRP
seemed VBD
so RB
; :
there EX
were VBD
only RB
five CD
of IN
them PRP
, ,
however RB
, ,
that WDT
were VBD
very RB
marked JJ
or CC
came VBD
much RB
in IN
the DT
foreground NN
; :
and CC
four CD
of IN
these DT
I PRP
knew VBD
well RB
, ,
though IN
I PRP
did VBD
not RB
then RB
remember VB
the DT
names NNS
of IN
those DT
that WDT
had VBD
borne VBN
them PRP
. .
They PRP
were VBD
Red NNP
Harald NNP
, ,
Swanhilda NNP
, ,
Amald NNP
, ,
and CC
myself PRP

The DT
fifth JJ
I PRP
did VBD
not RB
know VB
; :
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
woman NN

and CC
very RB
beautiful JJ

Then RB
I PRP
saw VBD
that IN
in IN
some DT
parts NNS
a DT
small JJ
penthouse NN
roof NN
had VBD
been VBN
built VBN
over IN
the DT
paintings NNS
, ,
to TO
keep VB
them PRP
from IN
the DT

Near IN
one CD
of IN
these DT
stood VBD
a DT
man NN
painting NN
, ,
clothed VBN
in IN
red JJ
, ,
with IN
stripes NNS
of IN
yellow JJ

black JJ
: :
Then RB
I PRP
knew VBD
that IN
it PRP
was VBD
the DT
same JJ
man NN
who WP
had VBD
saved VBN
me PRP
from IN
drowning VBG
by IN
spearing VBG
me PRP
through IN
the DT
shoulder NN
; :
so CC
I PRP
went VBD
up RB
to TO
him PRP
, ,
and CC
saw VBD
furthermore RB
that IN
he PRP
was VBD
girt NN
with IN
a DT
heavy JJ
sword NN

He PRP
turned VBD
round RP
when WRB
he PRP
saw VBD
me PRP
coming VBG
, ,
and CC
asked VBD
me PRP
fiercely RB
what WP
I PRP
did VBD
there RB
. .
I PRP
asked VBD
why WRB
he PRP
was VBD
painting VBG
in IN
my PRP$
castle NN
. .
Thereupon NNP
, ,
with IN
that DT
same JJ
grim JJ
smile NN
widening VBG
his PRP$
mouth NN
as IN
heretofore NN
, ,
he PRP
said VBD
, ,
`` ``

'' ''
And CC
as IN
he PRP
spoke VBD
, ,
he PRP
rattled VBD
the DT
sword NN
in IN
his PRP$
scabbard NN
; :
but CC
I PRP
said VBD

'' ''
Well NNP

then RB

While IN
I PRP
spoke VBD
he PRP
still RB
rattled VBD
his PRP$

, ,
and CC
when WRB
I PRP
had VBD
done VBN

shut VB
his PRP$
right NN
eye NN
tight VBD

screwing VBG
his PRP$
nose NN
on IN

then RB
said VBD

`` ``

I PRP

`` ``

And CC

coming VBG
close RB
up IN

me PRP

he PRP
struck VBD
me PRP
with IN
his PRP$

in IN

so IN
that IN
the DT

his PRP$

The DT

while IN

he PRP

Perhaps RB
it PRP

then RB
his PRP$

together RB

he PRP
rolled VBD

dead JJ

as IN
I PRP

I PRP

in IN

at IN

striking VBG

every DT

then RB

till NN
I PRP
grew VBD
faint NN
with IN

then RB
I PRP
went VBD
to TO
my PRP$

stripped VBD
off RP
some DT

to TO
bind VB
up RP

afterwards NNS
I PRP
found VBD

a DT
corner NN
bread NN

I PRP
eat VBP

Then RB
I PRP
went VBD
back RB

him PRP

and CC
looked VBD

and CC
a DT

me PRP
, ,
and CC
I PRP
took VBD
some DT

his PRP$

, ,
and CC
kneeling VBG
down RP

painted VBD

thus RB

with IN

red JJ

crossing VBG
each DT

in IN

so IN
made VBN
I PRP
put VBD

after IN

So IN
I PRP

folded VBD

admired VBD
my PRP$

Yet CC
there EX
struck VB
me PRP
as IN

something NN
so RB
utterly JJ
doleful NN
in IN
the DT
man NN

white JJ

the DT

running VBG

him PRP

that IN
my PRP$

gave VBD

I PRP
hoped VBD

I PRP
took VBD
some DT

he PRP

kneeling VBG

Was VB
it PRP
some DT

dead JJ

which WDT
I PRP

seen VBN
when WRB

that IN

me PRP
pity NN
him PRP

I PRP
laid VBD
my PRP$

upon IN
his PRP$

and CC
felt VBD
it PRP
beating VBG
feebly RB

so CC
I PRP
lifted VBD
him PRP
up RP
gently RB
, ,
and CC
carried VBD
him PRP
towards VB
a DT
heap NN
of IN
straw NN
that IN
he PRP
seemed VBD
used VBN

lie VB
upon RB

there EX
I PRP
stripped VBD
him PRP
and CC
looked VBD
to TO
his PRP$

and CC
used VBD
leech-craft NN

the DT
memory NN
of IN
which WDT
God NNP
gave VBD
me PRP
for IN
this DT

I PRP
suppose VBP

and CC
within IN
seven CD
days NNS
I PRP
found VBD
that IN

not RB

Afterwards NNS
, ,
as IN
I PRP
wandered VBD
about IN
the DT
castle NN

I PRP
came VBD
to TO
a DT

in IN
one CD

that WDT

still RB
the DT

it PRP

there RB
I PRP
found VBD
green JJ
raiment NN

I PRP
clothed VBD

So RB
when WRB
he PRP

well RB
I PRP
asked VBD
him PRP
what WP

he PRP
me PRP

we PRP

`` ``

Then RB

`` ``

`` ``

Then RB
I PRP

but CC
at IN

And CC

as IN

grey JJ

we PRP

always RB

And CC
we PRP

Often NNP

Once RB

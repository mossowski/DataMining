Up RP

Then RB

thus RB
it PRP

both DT

Now RB

did VBD
not RB
yet RB

what WP

Robin NNP

Arthur VB

so RB
waded VBD
on IN
in IN
silence NN
while IN

laughing VBG
upon IN

At IN
last JJ
he PRP
reached VBD
the DT
middle NN

Here RB

then RB

with IN

fairly RB

Down NNP
went VBD
Robin NNP
into IN

with IN
a DT
mighty JJ

`` ``

calmly RB

`` ``

Meantime NNP

after IN
much JJ

Robin NNP
had VBD
gotten VBN

stood VBD
gazing VBG
about IN
him PRP
all DT

the DT
water NN
running VBG

in IN
pretty RB

At IN

he PRP
shot VBD
the DT

out IN

spat VB
some DT
out IN

his PRP$

, ,
and CC

gathering VBG
his PRP$

together RB

saw VBD
the DT
stout NN

standing VBG

Then RB

I PRP

Robin NNP

So IN

he PRP

And CC
now RB
Robin NNP

having VBG

The DT

Then RB
Robin NNP

what WP

that IN

`` ``

drawing VBG

quoth VBZ
the DT
Friar NNP

who WP

So RB

without IN

they PRP

thereupon NN

Right NNP

left VBD

up RB

down RB

forth NN
they PRP

The DT

flashed VBN
in IN
the DT
sun NN

then RB
met VBD
with IN
a DT
clash NN
that WDT
sounded VBD
far RB

near IN

I PRP
wot VBP
this DT

no DT

a DT

Thus RB

pausing VBG
every DT

then RB
to TO

at IN

Yet CC

all PDT
this DT

neither CC

At IN

merry NN
Robin NNP

`` ``

whereupon IN
both DT

`` ``

`` ``

The DT

`` ``

Scarcely RB

Then RB
up IN

So IN

At IN

When WRB

then RB

so RB

slipping VBG
off RP
his PRP$

he PRP
also RB
huddled VBD

where WRB
Robin NNP

grunting VBG

made VBD

Robin NNP

I PRP

As IN

you PRP

So IN
the DT
night NN

enough RB

but CC
at IN
the DT
first JJ
dawn NN

Robin NNP
opened VBD
his PRP$

turned VBD

Then RB
how WRB
he PRP
gaped VBD

for IN
there EX

so RB
that IN

He PRP

finding VBG
he PRP

sat VBD
up RP

while IN

`` ``

So IN

he PRP

so RB
as IN
not RB

waken VB
the DT

looking VBG

First NNP

All PDT

So IN

The DT

The DT

they PRP

The DT

As IN

talking VBG

Thus RB

Neither CC

that IN

the DT

All PDT

so RB

The DT

Many PDT

that DT

at IN

Sir NNP

Dale NNP
being VBG

most JJS

he PRP

But CC

left VBN

him PRP

stretched VBD
out RP
all DT

But CC
though IN

beaten VBN
off RP
his PRP$

in IN
fair JJ
fight NN
, ,
all PDT
this DT
lay VBD
heavily RB
upon IN
his PRP$
mind NN

so RB
that IN
he PRP
brooded VBD
over IN
it PRP
until IN
a DT
fever NN
seized VBN
upon IN
him PRP

For IN
three CD
days NNS
it PRP
held VBD
him PRP

and CC
though IN
he PRP
strove VB

fight VB
it PRP
off RP

he PRP
was VBD
forced VBN

at IN

Thus VB
it PRP
came VBD
that IN
, ,
on IN
the DT
morning NN
of IN
the DT
fourth JJ
day NN
, ,
he PRP
called VBD
Little NNP
John NNP

and CC
told VBD
him PRP
that IN

not RB
shake VB
the DT

and CC
that IN

the DT

near IN
Kirklees NNP

in IN
Yorkshire NNP

who WP
was VBD
a DT
skillful JJ
leech NN

and CC
he PRP
would MD
have VB
her PRP$
open JJ
a DT

and CC
take VB
a DT
little JJ
blood NN
from IN
him PRP
, ,
for IN
the DT
bettering NN
of IN

Then RB
he PRP
bade VBD
Little NNP
John NNP
make VBP
ready JJ
to TO
go VB
also RB
, ,
for IN
he PRP
might MD
perchance VB
need NN

So RB
Little JJ
John NNP
and CC
he PRP
took VBD
their PRP$
leave NN
of IN

and CC
Robin NNP
Hood NNP
bade NN
Will NNP
Stutely RB

the DT

until IN

Thus NN
they PRP
came VBD
by IN
easy JJ
stages NNS
and CC
slow VB
journeying NN
until IN
they PRP
reached VBD
the DT
Nunnery NNP
of IN
Kirklees NNP

Now RB
Robin NNP
had VBD
done VBN
much RB
to TO
aid VB
this DT
cousin NN
of IN
his PRP$
; :
for IN
it PRP
was VBD
through IN
King NNP
Richard NNP

love NN
of IN
him PRP
that IN
she PRP

been VBN
made VBN
prioress NN
of IN

But CC
there EX
is VBZ
nought VBN
in IN
the DT
world NN
so RB
easily RB
forgot VBN

; :
so RB
, ,
when WRB
the DT
Prioress NNP

Kirklees NNP
had VBD
heard VBN
how WRB
her PRP$

, ,
the DT
Earl NNP

Huntingdon NNP

had VBD
thrown VBN
away RP
his PRP$
earldom NN
and CC
gone VBN
back RB
again RB
to TO
Sherwood NNP
, ,
she PRP
was VBD
vexed VBN
to TO
the DT
soul NN
, ,
and CC
feared VBD
lest JJS
her PRP$
cousinship NN
with IN
him PRP
should MD
bring VB
the DT
King NNP

wrath NN
upon IN
her PRP$
also RB

Thus VB
it PRP
happened VBD
that IN
when WRB
Robin NNP
came VBD
to TO
her PRP$
and CC
told VBD
her PRP$
how WRB
he PRP
wished VBD
her PRP
services NNS
as IN
leech NN
, ,
she PRP
began VBD
plotting VBG
ill NN
against IN
him PRP
in IN
her PRP$
mind NN
, ,
thinking VBG
that IN
by IN
doing VBG
evil JJ
to TO
him PRP
she PRP
might MD
find VB
favor NN
with IN
his PRP$
enemies NNS

Nevertheless RB
, ,
she PRP
kept VBD
this DT
well NN
to TO
herself VB
and CC
received VB
Robin NNP
with IN
seeming VBG
kindness NN

She PRP
led VBD
him PRP
up RP
the DT
winding VBG
stone NN

to TO
a DT
room NN
which WDT
was VBD
just RB
beneath IN
the DT
eaves NNS
of IN
a DT

, ,
round VB
tower NN
; :
but CC
she PRP
would MD
not RB
let VB
Little NNP
John NNP
come VBP
with IN
him PRP
. .
So IN
the DT
poor JJ
yeoman NN
turned VBD
his PRP$
feet NNS
away RB
from IN
the DT
door NN
of IN
the DT
nunnery NN
, ,
and CC
left VBD
his PRP$

in IN

But CC
, ,
though IN
he PRP
did VBD
not RB
come VBN
in IN
, ,
neither CC
did VBD
he PRP
go VB
far RB
away RB
; :
for IN
he PRP
laid VBD
him PRP
down RP
in IN
a DT
little JJ

near IN

where WRB
he PRP
could MD
watch VB

that WDT
Robin NNP

like IN

great JJ

faithful JJ

turned VBD
away RB
from IN
the DT

where WRB
his PRP$

entered VBN

After IN
the DT

had VBD
gotten VBN
Robin NNP
Hood NNP
to TO
the DT
room NN
beneath IN
the DT
eaves NNS
, ,
the DT
Prioress NNP
sent VBD
all DT

away RB
; :
then RB
, ,
taking VBG
a DT
little JJ
cord NN
, ,
she PRP
tied VBD
it PRP
tightly RB
about IN
Robin NNP

arm NN
, ,
as IN
though IN
she PRP
were VBD
about RB
to TO
bleed VB
him PRP

And CC
so RB
she PRP
did VBD
bleed VB
him PRP
, ,
but CC
the DT
vein NN
she PRP
opened VBD
was VBD
not RB
one CD

those DT
that WDT
lie VBP
close JJ
and CC
blue JJ
beneath NN
the DT

; :
deeper JJR
she PRP
cut VBD
than IN
that DT
, ,
for IN
she PRP
opened VBD
one CD
of IN
those DT
veins NNS
through IN
which WDT
the DT
bright NN
red JJ
blood NN
runs NNS
leaping VBG
from IN
the DT
heart NN

Of IN
this DT
Robin NNP
knew VBD
not RB
; :
for IN
, ,
though IN
he PRP
saw VBD
the DT
blood NN
flow NN
, ,
it PRP
did VBD
not RB
come VBN
fast RB
enough JJ
to TO
make VB
him PRP
think VB
that IN
there EX

anything NN
ill NN
in IN
it PRP

Having VBG
done VBN
this DT
vile NN
deed NN
, ,
the DT
Prioress NNP
turned VBD
and CC
left VBD
her PRP$
cousin NN
, ,
locking VBG
the DT

behind IN
her PRP

All PDT
that IN

day NN
the DT
blood NN
ran NN
from IN
Robin NNP
Hood NNP

nor CC
could MD
he PRP
check VB
it PRP

though IN
he PRP
strove VB
in IN
every DT

so RB

Again NNP

again RB
he PRP
called VBD

but CC
no DT

came VBD

for IN
his PRP$
cousin NN

betrayed VBN
him PRP

and CC
Little NNP
John NNP
was VBD
too RB
far RB
away RB
to TO
hear VB
his PRP$

So IN
he PRP
bled VBD

bled VBD
until IN
he PRP
felt VBD
his PRP$

slipping VBG
away RB

Then RB
he PRP
arose VBD

tottering VBG

and CC
bearing VBG
himself PRP
up IN
by IN
the DT

his PRP$

he PRP
reached VBD

at IN

Thrice NN
he PRP
sounded VBD
it PRP

but CC
weakly RB

faintly RB

for IN
his PRP$
breath NN
was VBD
fluttering VBG
through IN
sickness NN

loss NN
of IN

; :
nevertheless CC

Little NNP
John NNP
heard VBD
it PRP
where WRB
he PRP
lay VBD
in IN
the DT
glade NN
, ,
and CC
, ,
with IN
a DT
heart NN
all DT
sick JJ

he PRP
came VBD
running VBG

leaping VBG
toward IN
the DT

Loudly RB
he PRP
knocked VBD

the DT

in IN
a DT
loud JJ

shouted VBD

the DT

so IN

Then RB
Little NNP
John NNP

Wildly RB
he PRP

his PRP$

such JJ

Little NNP

Staggering VBG

In IN

Then RB

Here RB

There EX

Then RB

Little NNP

As IN
he PRP
finished VBD
speaking NN
, ,
he PRP
raised VBD
himself PRP

a DT
sudden JJ

sat JJ
upright NN

His PRP$

drawing VBG
the DT

to TO
his PRP$

he PRP
sped VBD

out IN

As IN
the DT

flew VBD

his PRP$

sank VBD
slowly RB
with IN

it PRP
lay VBD

his PRP$

likewise NN

Little NNP

but CC
something NN

sped VBN
from IN
that DT
body NN
, ,
even RB
as IN
the DT
winged JJ

sped VBD
from IN

For IN
some DT
minutes NNS
Little NNP
John NNP
sat VBD
motionless NN
, ,
but CC
presently RB
he PRP
laid VBD
that IN
which WDT
he PRP
held VBD
gently RB
down RB
, ,
then RB
, ,
folding VBG
the DT
hands NNS
upon IN
the DT

covering VBG
up RP

he PRP
turned VBD
upon RP
his PRP$

left VBD
the DT

without IN

Upon IN

steep JJ

he PRP
met VBD
the DT
Prioress NNP

some DT

the DT

among IN

To TO
them PRP
he PRP
spoke VBD
in IN
a DT
deep JJ

quivering JJ

and CC
said VBD
he PRP
, ,
'' ''

So IN
saying VBG

he PRP

they PRP
presently RB

him PRP
running VBG
rapidly RB

through IN

the DT

, ,
until IN
he PRP

swallowed VBN
up RP

The DT
early JJ
gray NN

just RB
beginning VBG

having VBG
been VBN
frightened VBN
by IN
Little NNP
John NNP

words NNS

Up IN

they PRP
ran VBD

and CC
a DT
great JJ
sound NN

presently RB

After IN

as IN
they PRP

So IN
they PRP
went VBD
forth NN
from IN

as IN
they PRP
passed VBD

a DT

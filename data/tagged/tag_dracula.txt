Vienna NNP
early JJ
next JJ

; :
should MD

arrived VBN
at IN
6:46 CD
, ,
but CC
train NN
was VBD
an DT
hour NN
late RB
. .
Buda-Pesth JJ
seems VBZ
a DT
wonderful JJ
place NN
, ,
from IN
the DT
glimpse NN
which WDT
I PRP
got VBD
of IN
it PRP
from IN
the DT
train NN
and CC
the DT
little JJ
I PRP
could MD
walk VB
through IN
the DT
streets NNS
. .
I PRP
feared VBD
to TO
go VB
very RB
far RB
from IN
the DT
station NN
, ,
as IN
we PRP
had VBD
arrived VBN
late JJ
and CC
would MD
start VB
as IN
near IN
the DT
correct JJ
time NN
as IN
possible JJ
. .
The DT
impression NN
I PRP
had VBD
was VBD
that IN
we PRP
were VBD
leaving VBG
the DT
West NNP
and CC
entering VBG
the DT
East NNP
; :
the DT
most RBS
western JJ
of IN
splendid JJ
bridges NNS
over IN
the DT
Danube NNP
, ,
which WDT
is VBZ
here RB
of IN
noble JJ
width NN
and CC
depth NN
, ,
took VBD
us PRP
among IN
the DT
traditions NNS
of IN
Turkish JJ
rule NN
. .
We PRP
left VBD
in IN
pretty RB
good JJ
time NN
, ,
and CC
came VBD
after IN
nightfall DT
to TO
Klausenburgh NNP
. .
Here RB
I PRP
stopped VBD
for IN
the DT
night NN
at IN
the DT
Hotel NNP
Royale NNP
. .
I PRP
had VBD
for IN
dinner NN
, ,
or CC
rather RB
supper JJ
, ,
a DT
chicken NN
done VBN
up RP
some DT
way NN
with IN
red JJ
pepper NN
, ,
which WDT
was VBD
very RB
good JJ
but CC
thirsty JJ
. .
I PRP
asked VBD
the DT
waiter NN
, ,
and CC
he PRP
said VBD
it PRP
was VBD
called VBN
`` ``
paprika JJ
hendl NN
, ,
'' ''
and CC
that DT
, ,
as IN
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
national JJ
dish NN
, ,
I PRP
should MD
be VB
able JJ
to TO
get VB
it PRP
anywhere RB
along IN
the DT
Carpathians NNPS
. .
I PRP
found VBD
my PRP$
smattering NN
of IN
German JJ
very RB
useful JJ
here RB
; :
indeed RB
, ,
I PRP
do VBP
n't RB
know VB
how WRB
I PRP
should MD
be VB
able JJ
to TO
get VB
on IN
without IN
it PRP

Having VBG
had VBD
some DT
time NN
at IN
my PRP$
disposal NN
when WRB
in IN
London NNP
, ,
I PRP
had VBD
visited VBN
the DT
British JJ
Museum NNP
, ,
and CC
made VBD
search NN
among IN
the DT
books NNS
and CC
maps NNS
in IN
the DT
library JJ
regarding NN
Transylvania NNP
; :
it PRP
had VBD
struck VBN
me PRP
that IN
some DT
foreknowledge NN
of IN
the DT
country NN
could MD
hardly RB
fail VB
to TO
have VB
some DT
importance NN
in IN
dealing VBG
with IN
a DT
nobleman NN
of IN
that DT
country NN
. .
I PRP
find VBP
that IN
the DT
district NN
he PRP
named VBD
is VBZ
in IN
the DT
extreme JJ
east NN
of IN
the DT
country NN
, ,
just RB
on IN
the DT
borders NNS
of IN
three CD
states NNS
, ,
Transylvania NNP
, ,
Moldavia NNP
and CC
Bukovina NNP
, ,
in IN
the DT
midst NN
of IN
the DT
Carpathian JJ
mountains NNS
; :
one CD
of IN
the DT
wildest JJS
and CC
least JJS
known JJ
portions NNS
of IN
Europe NNP

I PRP
was VBD
not RB
able JJ
to TO
light VB
on IN
any DT
map NN
or CC
work NN
giving VBG
the DT
exact JJ
locality NN
of IN
the DT
Castle NNP
Dracula NNP
, ,
as IN
there EX
are VBP
no DT
maps NNS
of IN
this DT
country NN
as IN
yet RB
to TO
compare VB
with IN
our PRP$
own JJ
Ordnance NNP
Survey NNP
maps VBZ
; :
but CC
I PRP
found VBD
that IN
Bistritz NNP
, ,
the DT
post NN
town NN
named VBN
by IN
Count NNP
Dracula NNP
, ,
is VBZ
a DT
fairly RB
well-known JJ
place NN

I PRP
shall MD
enter VB
here RB
some DT
of IN
my PRP$
notes NNS
, ,
as IN
they PRP
may MD
refresh VB
my PRP$
memory NN
when WRB
I PRP
talk VBP
over IN
my PRP$
travels NNS
with IN
Mina NNP
. .
In IN
the DT
population NN
of IN
Transylvania NNP
there EX
are VBP
four CD
distinct JJ
nationalities NNS
: :
Saxons NNS
in IN
the DT
South NNP
, ,
and CC
mixed JJ
with IN
them PRP
the DT
Wallachs NNP
, ,
who WP
are VBP
the DT
descendants NNS
of IN
the DT
Dacians NNPS
; :
Magyars NNP
in IN
the DT
West NNP
, ,
and CC
Szekelys NNP
in IN
the DT
East NNP
and CC
North NNP

I PRP
am VBP
going VBG
among IN
the DT
latter NN
, ,
who WP
claim VBP
to TO
be VB
descended VBN
from IN
Attila NNP
and CC
the DT
Huns NNP
. .
This DT
may MD
be VB
so RB
, ,
for IN
when WRB
the DT
Magyars NNP
conquered VBD
the DT
country NN
in IN
the DT
eleventh JJ
century NN
they PRP
found VBD
the DT
Huns NNP
settled VBD
in IN
it PRP
. .
I PRP
read VBP
that IN
every DT
known VBN
superstition NN
in IN
the DT
world NN
is VBZ
gathered VBN
into IN
the DT
horseshoe NN
of IN
the DT
Carpathians NNPS
, ,
as IN
if IN
it PRP
were VBD
the DT
centre NN
of IN
some DT
sort NN
of IN
imaginative JJ
whirlpool NN
; :
if IN
so IN
my PRP$
stay NN
may MD
be VB
very RB
interesting JJ

( (
Mem NNP

, ,
I PRP
must MD
ask VB
the DT
Count NNP
all DT
about IN
them PRP

) )
I PRP
did VBD
not RB
sleep VB
well RB
, ,
though IN
my PRP$
bed NN
was VBD
comfortable JJ
enough RB
, ,
for IN
I PRP
had VBD
all DT
sorts NNS
of IN
queer NN
dreams NNS
. .
There EX
was VBD
a DT
dog NN
howling VBG
all DT
night NN
under IN
my PRP$
window NN
, ,
which WDT
may MD
have VB
had VBD
something NN
to TO
do VB
with IN
it PRP
; :
or CC
it PRP
may MD
have VB
been VBN
the DT
paprika NN
, ,
for IN
I PRP
had VBD
to TO
drink VB
up RP
all PDT
the DT
water NN
in IN
my PRP$
carafe NN
, ,
and CC
was VBD
still RB
thirsty JJ
. .
Towards IN
morning NN
I PRP
slept VBD
and CC
was VBD
wakened VBN
by IN
the DT
continuous JJ
knocking NN
at IN
my PRP$
door NN
, ,
so IN
I PRP
guess VBP
I PRP
must MD
have VB
been VBN
sleeping VBG
soundly RB
then RB
. .
I PRP
had VBD
for IN
breakfast NN
more RBR
paprika JJ
, ,
and CC
a DT
sort NN
of IN
porridge NN
of IN
maize FW
flour NNS
which WDT
they PRP
said VBD
was VBD
`` ``
mamaliga NN
, ,
'' ''
and CC
egg-plant JJ
stuffed NN
with IN
forcemeat NN
, ,
a DT
very RB
excellent JJ
dish NN
, ,
which WDT
they PRP
call VBP
`` ``
impletata NN

'' ''
( (
Mem NNP
. .
, ,
get VB
recipe NN
for IN
this DT
also RB

) )
I PRP
had VBD
to TO
hurry VB
breakfast NN
, ,
for IN
the DT
train NN
started VBD
a DT
little JJ
before RB
eight CD
, ,
or CC
rather RB
it PRP
ought MD
to TO
have VB
done VBN
so RB
, ,
for IN
after IN
rushing VBG
to TO
the DT
station NN
at IN
7:30 CD
I PRP
had VBD
to TO
sit VB
in IN
the DT
carriage NN
for IN
more JJR
than IN
an DT
hour NN
before IN
we PRP
began VBD
to TO
move VB
. .
It PRP
seems VBZ
to TO
me PRP
that IN
the DT
further JJ
east NN
you PRP
go VBP
the DT
more RBR
unpunctual JJ
are VBP
the DT
trains NNS
. .
What WP
ought VBD
they PRP
to TO
be VB
in IN
China NNP
? .
All DT
day NN
long IN
we PRP
seemed VBD
to TO
dawdle VB
through IN
a DT
country NN
which WDT
was VBD
full JJ
of IN
beauty NN
of IN
every DT
kind NN
. .
Sometimes RB
we PRP
saw VBD
little JJ
towns NNS
or CC
castles NNS
on IN
the DT
top NN
of IN
steep JJ
hills NNS
such JJ
as IN
we PRP
see VBP
in IN
old JJ
missals NNS
; :
sometimes RB
we PRP
ran VBP
by IN
rivers NNS
and CC
streams NNS
which WDT
seemed VBD
from IN
the DT
wide JJ
stony NN
margin NN
on IN
each DT
side NN
of IN
them PRP
to TO
be VB
subject JJ
to TO
great JJ
floods NNS
. .
It PRP
takes VBZ
a DT
lot NN
of IN
water NN
, ,
and CC
running VBG
strong JJ
, ,
to TO
sweep VB
the DT
outside JJ
edge NN
of IN
a DT
river NN
clear JJ
. .
At IN
every DT
station NN
there EX
were VBD
groups NNS
of IN
people NNS
, ,
sometimes RB
crowds NN
, ,
and CC
in IN
all DT
sorts NNS
of IN
attire NN
. .
Some DT
of IN
them PRP
were VBD
just RB
like IN
the DT
peasants NNS
at IN
home NN
or CC
those DT
I PRP
saw VBD
coming VBG
through IN
France NNP
and CC
Germany NNP
, ,
with IN
short JJ
jackets NNS
and CC
round NN
hats NNS
and CC
home-made JJ
trousers NNS
; :
but CC
others NNS
were VBD
very RB
picturesque JJ
. .
The DT
women NNS
looked VBD
pretty RB
, ,
except IN
when WRB
you PRP
got VBD
near IN
them PRP
, ,
but CC
they PRP
were VBD
very RB
clumsy JJ
about IN
the DT
waist NN
. .
They PRP
had VBD
all DT
full JJ
white JJ
sleeves NNS
of IN
some DT
kind NN
or CC
other JJ
, ,
and CC
most JJS
of IN
them PRP
had VBD
big JJ
belts NNS
with IN
a DT
lot NN
of IN
strips NNS
of IN
something NN
fluttering VBG
from IN
them PRP
like IN
the DT
dresses NNS
in IN
a DT
ballet NN
, ,
but CC
of IN
course NN
there EX
were VBD
petticoats NNS
under IN
them PRP
. .
The DT
strangest JJS
figures NNS
we PRP
saw VBD
were VBD
the DT
Slovaks NNP
, ,
who WP
were VBD
more JJR
barbarian JJ
than IN
the DT
rest NN
, ,
with IN
their PRP$
big JJ
cow-boy NN
hats NNS
, ,
great JJ
baggy JJ
dirty-white JJ
trousers NNS
, ,
white JJ
linen NN
shirts NNS
, ,
and CC
enormous JJ
heavy NN
leather NN
belts NNS
, ,
nearly RB
a DT
foot NN
wide JJ
, ,
all DT
studded VBD
over RP
with IN
brass NN
nails NNS
. .
They PRP
wore VBP
high JJ
boots NNS
, ,
with IN
their PRP$
trousers NNS
tucked VBN
into IN
them PRP
, ,
and CC
had VBD
long JJ
black JJ
hair NN
and CC
heavy JJ
black JJ
moustaches NNS
. .
They PRP
are VBP
very RB
picturesque JJ
, ,
but CC
do VBP
not RB
look VB
prepossessing VBG
. .
On IN
the DT
stage NN
they PRP
would MD
be VB
set VBN
down RP
at IN
once RB
as IN
some DT
old JJ
Oriental JJ
band NN
of IN
brigands NNS
. .
They PRP
are VBP
, ,
however RB
, ,
I PRP
am VBP
told RB
, ,
very RB
harmless JJ
and CC
rather RB
wanting VBG
in IN
natural JJ
self-assertion NN
. .
It PRP
was VBD
on IN
the DT
dark JJ
side NN
of IN
twilight NN
when WRB
we PRP
got VBD
to TO
Bistritz NNP
, ,
which WDT
is VBZ
a DT
very RB
interesting JJ
old JJ
place NN
. .
Being VBG
practically RB
on IN
the DT
frontier NN
for IN
the DT
Borgo NNP
Pass NNP
leads VBZ
from IN
it PRP
into IN
Bukovina NNP
it PRP
has VBZ
had VBD
a DT
very RB
stormy JJ
existence NN
, ,
and CC
it PRP
certainly RB
shows VBZ
marks NNS
of IN
it PRP
. .
Fifty CD
years NNS
ago RB
a DT
series NN
of IN
great JJ
fires NNS
took VBD
place NN
, ,
which WDT
made VBD
terrible JJ
havoc NN
on IN
five CD
separate JJ
occasions NNS
. .
At IN
the DT
very RB
beginning NN
of IN
the DT
seventeenth JJ
century NN
it PRP
underwent VBD
a DT
siege NN
of IN
three CD
weeks NNS
and CC
lost VBD
13,000 CD
people NNS
, ,
the DT
casualties NNS
of IN
war NN
proper IN
being VBG
assisted VBN
by IN
famine NN
and CC
disease NN
. .
Count NNP
Dracula NNP
had VBD
directed VBN
me PRP
to TO
go VB
to TO
the DT
Golden NNP
Krone NNP
Hotel NNP
, ,
which WDT
I PRP
found VBD
, ,
to TO
my PRP$
great JJ
delight NN
, ,
to TO
be VB
thoroughly RB
old-fashioned JJ
, ,
for IN
of IN
course NN
I PRP
wanted VBD
to TO
see VB
all DT
I PRP
could MD
of IN
the DT
ways NNS
of IN
the DT
country NN
. .
I PRP
was VBD
evidently RB
expected VBN
, ,
for IN
when WRB
I PRP
got VBD
near IN
the DT
door NN
I PRP
faced VBD
a DT
cheery-looking JJ
elderly JJ
woman NN
in IN
the DT
usual JJ
peasant NN
dress NN
white JJ
undergarment JJ
with IN
long JJ
double JJ
apron NN
, ,
front NN
, ,
and CC
back RB
, ,
of IN
coloured VBN
stuff NN
fitting VBG
almost RB
too RB
tight JJ
for IN
modesty NN

When WRB
I PRP
came VBD
close RB
she PRP
bowed VBD
and CC
said VBD
, ,
`` ``
The DT
Herr NNP
Englishman NNP

'' ''
`` ``

I PRP
said VBD
, ,
`` ``

She PRP
smiled VBD

and CC
gave VBD
some DT
message NN
to TO
an DT
elderly JJ
man NN
in IN
white JJ
shirt-sleeves NNS

who WP
had VBD
followed VBN
her PRP

He PRP

I PRP

directing VBG
him PRP

but CC
on IN
making VBG
inquiries NNS
as IN

he PRP
seemed VBD
somewhat RB
reticent JJ

pretended VBD
that IN

not RB

my PRP$
German JJ

This DT
could MD
not RB
be VB
true JJ

because IN
up IN

he PRP

perfectly RB
; :
at IN

he PRP
answered VBD
my PRP$

exactly RB

He PRP

his PRP$

the DT
old JJ

who WP

looked VBD
at IN

a DT

He PRP

out RP
that IN

that DT

all DT

When WRB

saying VBG
that IN

at IN
all DT

simply RB

It PRP

Just NNP
before IN

the DT

One CD

One CD

The DT

The DT

saw VBD
it PRP
at IN
the DT

moment NN
; :
he PRP
at IN
once RB
checked VBN
the DT
horses NNS
, ,
and CC

jumping VBG
to TO
the DT

disappeared VBD
into IN
the DT
darkness NN

I PRP
did VBD
not RB

what WP
to TO

, ,
the DT
less NN
as IN
the DT
howling NN
of IN
the DT

but CC
while IN
I PRP
wondered VBD
the DT
driver NN
suddenly RB
appeared VBD
again RB
, ,
and CC
without IN
a DT
word NN
took VBD
his PRP$
seat NN
, ,
and CC
we PRP
resumed VBD
our PRP$
journey NN

I PRP
think VBP
I PRP
must MD
have VB
fallen VBN
asleep RB
and CC
kept VBD
dreaming NN
of IN
the DT
incident NN
, ,
for IN
it PRP
seemed VBD

repeated VBN
endlessly RB
, ,
and CC
now RB
looking VBG
back RB
, ,
it PRP
is VBZ
like IN
a DT
sort NN
of IN
awful JJ
nightmare NN

Once IN
the DT
flame NN
appeared VBD
so RB
near IN
the DT
road NN
, ,
that WDT
even RB
in IN
the DT
darkness NN
around IN
us PRP
I PRP
could MD
watch VB
the DT
driver NN

motions NNS

He PRP
went VBD
rapidly RB
to TO
where WRB
the DT
blue NN
flame NN
arose VBD
it PRP
must MD
have VB
been VBN
very RB
faint JJ
, ,
for IN
it PRP
did VBD
not RB
seem VB
to TO
illumine VB
the DT
place NN
around IN
it PRP
at IN
all DT
and CC
gathering VBG
a DT
few JJ
stones NNS
, ,
formed VBD
them PRP
into IN
some DT
device NN

Once RB
there RB
appeared VBD
a DT
strange JJ
optical JJ
effect NN
: :
when WRB
he PRP
stood VBD
between IN
me PRP
and CC
the DT
flame NN
he PRP
did VBD
not RB
obstruct VB
it PRP
, ,
for IN
I PRP
could MD
see VB
its PRP$
ghostly RB
flicker VBN
all PDT
the DT

This DT
startled VBD
me PRP
, ,
but CC
as IN
the DT
effect NN
was VBD
only RB
momentary JJ
, ,
I PRP
took VBD
it PRP
that IN
my PRP$
eyes NNS
deceived VBD
me PRP
straining VBG
through IN
the DT
darkness NN
. .
Then RB
for IN
a DT
time NN
there EX
were VBD
no DT
blue JJ
flames NNS
, ,
and CC
we PRP
sped VBD
onwards NNS
through IN
the DT
gloom NN
, ,
with IN
the DT
howling NN
of IN
the DT
wolves NNS
around IN
us PRP
, ,
as IN
though IN
they PRP
were VBD
following VBG
in IN
a DT
moving JJ
circle NN

At IN
last JJ
there EX
came VBD
a DT
time NN
when WRB
the DT
driver NN
went VBD
further RB
afield NN
than IN
he PRP
had VBD
yet RB
gone VBN
, ,
and CC
during IN
his PRP$
absence NN
, ,
the DT
horses NNS
began VBD
to TO
tremble JJ
worse JJR
than IN
ever RB
and CC
to TO
snort VB
and CC
scream VB
with IN
fright NN

I PRP
could MD
not RB
see VB
any DT
cause NN
for IN
it PRP
, ,
for IN
the DT
howling NN
of IN
the DT
wolves NNS
had VBD
ceased VBN
altogether RB
; :
but CC
just RB
then RB
the DT
moon NN
, ,
sailing VBG
through IN
the DT
black JJ
clouds NN
, ,
appeared VBD
behind IN
the DT
jagged JJ
crest NN
of IN
a DT
beetling NN
, ,
pine-clad JJ
rock NN
, ,
and CC
by IN
its PRP$
light NN
I PRP
saw VBD
around IN
us PRP
a DT
ring NN
of IN
wolves NNS
, ,
with IN
white JJ
teeth NNS
and CC
lolling VBG
red JJ
tongues NNS
, ,
with IN
long JJ
, ,
sinewy JJ
limbs NNS
and CC
shaggy JJ
hair NN

They PRP
were VBD
a DT
hundred JJ
times NNS
more RBR
terrible JJ
in IN
the DT
grim JJ
silence NN
which WDT
held VBD
them PRP
than IN
even RB
when WRB
they PRP
howled VBD

For IN
myself PRP
, ,
I PRP
felt VBD
a DT
sort NN
of IN
paralysis NN
of IN
fear NN

It PRP
is VBZ
only RB
when WRB
a DT
man NN
feels VBZ
himself PRP
face NN
to TO
face VB
with IN
such JJ
horrors NNS
that IN
he PRP
can MD
understand VB
their PRP$
true JJ

All DT
at IN
once RB
the DT
wolves NNS
began VBD
to TO
howl VB
as IN
though IN
the DT
moonlight NN
had VBD
had VBN
some DT
peculiar JJ
effect NN
on IN
them PRP
. .
The DT
horses NNS
jumped VBD
about IN
and CC
reared VBD
, ,
and CC
looked VBD
helplessly RB
round VBN
with IN
eyes NNS
that WDT
rolled VBD
in IN
a DT
way NN
painful JJ
to TO
see VB
; :
but CC
the DT
living NN
ring NN
of IN
terror NN
encompassed VBD
them PRP
on IN
every DT
side NN
; :
and CC
they PRP
had VBD
perforce NN
to TO
remain VB
within IN
it PRP
. .
I PRP
called VBD
to TO
the DT
coachman NN
to TO
come VB
, ,
for IN
it PRP
seemed VBD
to TO
me PRP
that IN
our PRP$
only JJ
chance NN
was VBD
to TO
try VB
to TO
break VB
out RP
through IN
the DT
ring NN
and CC
to TO
aid VB
his PRP$

I PRP
shouted VBD
and CC
beat VBD
the DT
side NN
of IN
the DT
calèche NN
, ,
hoping VBG
by IN
the DT
noise NN
to TO
scare VB
the DT
wolves NNS
from IN
that DT
side NN
, ,
so RB
as IN
to TO
give VB
him PRP
a DT
chance NN
of IN
reaching VBG
the DT
trap NN
. .
How WRB
he PRP
came VBD
there RB
, ,
I PRP
know VBP
not RB
, ,
but CC
I PRP
heard VBD
his PRP$
voice NN
raised VBN
in IN
a DT
tone NN
of IN
imperious JJ
command NN
, ,
and CC
looking VBG
towards IN
the DT
sound NN
, ,
saw VBD
him PRP
stand VB
in IN
the DT
roadway NN

As IN
he PRP
swept VBD
his PRP$
long JJ
arms NNS
, ,
as IN
though IN
brushing VBG
aside RB
some DT
impalpable JJ
obstacle NN
, ,
the DT
wolves NNS
fell VBD
back RB
and CC
back RB
further RB
still RB
. .
Just NNP
then RB
a DT
heavy JJ
cloud NN
passed VBN
across IN
the DT
face NN
of IN
the DT
moon NN
, ,
so IN
that IN
we PRP
were VBD
again RB
in IN
darkness NN

When WRB
I PRP
could MD
see VB
again RB
the DT
driver NN
was VBD
climbing VBG
into IN
the DT
calèche NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
wolves NNS
had VBD
disappeared VBN

This DT
was VBD
all DT
so RB
strange JJ
and CC
uncanny JJ
that IN
a DT
dreadful JJ
fear NN
came VBD
upon IN
me PRP
, ,
and CC
I PRP
was VBD
afraid JJ
to TO
speak VB
or CC

The DT
time NN
seemed VBD
interminable JJ
as IN
we PRP
swept VBP
on IN
our PRP$
way NN
, ,
now RB
in IN
almost RB
complete JJ
darkness NN
, ,
for IN
the DT
rolling NN
clouds NN
obscured VBD
the DT
moon NN

We PRP
kept VBD
on IN

, ,
with IN
occasional JJ
periods NNS
of IN
quick JJ
descent NN
, ,
but CC
in IN
the DT
main JJ
always RB
ascending VBG

Suddenly RB
, ,
I PRP
became VBD
conscious JJ
of IN
the DT
fact NN
that IN
the DT

was VBD
in IN
the DT
act NN
of IN
pulling VBG
up RP
the DT

in IN
the DT

from IN

no DT

I PRP

fully RB

I PRP
must MD
have VB
noticed VBN
the DT

of IN
such JJ
a DT
remarkable JJ
place NN

In IN
the DT
gloom NN
the DT

looked VBD
of IN
considerable JJ
size NN

and CC
as IN
several JJ
dark JJ
ways NNS
led VBN

it PRP
under IN
great JJ

it PRP
perhaps RB

really RB

I PRP
have VBP
not RB
yet RB
been VBN
able JJ

When WRB
the DT

stopped VBD

the DT
driver NN
jumped VBD
down RB
and CC
held VBD
out RP
his PRP$

to TO
assist VB

Again NNP
I PRP
could MD
not RB
but CC
notice RB
his PRP$
prodigious JJ
strength NN

His PRP$
hand NN
actually RB
seemed VBD
like IN
a DT
steel NN
vice NN
that WDT

crushed VBN
mine NN
if IN
he PRP

Then RB
he PRP
took VBD
out RP
my PRP$

placed VBD
them PRP
on IN

beside RB
me PRP
as IN
I PRP

a DT

I PRP
could MD
see VB
even RB
in IN
the DT
dim NN
light NN
that IN
the DT

was VBD
massively RB
carved VBN
, ,
but CC
that IN
the DT
carving NN
had VBD
been VBN
much JJ
worn VBN
by IN
time NN

weather NN

As IN
I PRP
stood VBD
, ,
the DT
driver NN
jumped VBD
again RB
into IN
his PRP$

and CC
shook VB
the DT
reins NNS

the DT

started VBD

all DT

down RP
one CD

I PRP

where WRB

for IN
I PRP

not RB

Of IN

it PRP

not RB

that IN

The DT

I PRP

endless JJ

I PRP

What WP

What WP

that IN

I PRP

I PRP
began VBD
to TO
rub VB
my PRP$
eyes NNS

pinch NN
myself PRP
to TO

if IN
I PRP

It PRP
all DT
seemed VBD
like IN
a DT
horrible JJ

to TO
me PRP

and CC
I PRP
expected VBD
that IN

suddenly RB
awake VB

find VB
myself PRP
at IN

with IN
the DT
dawn NN
struggling VBG

as IN
I PRP
had VBD
now RB
and CC
again RB
felt VBD
in IN
the DT
morning NN
after IN
a DT

of IN

But CC
my PRP$
flesh JJ
answered VBD
the DT
pinching VBG

and CC
my PRP$
eyes NNS
were VBD
not RB
to TO
be VB

I PRP

indeed RB

among IN
the DT
Carpathians NNPS

All DT
I PRP

now RB
was VBD
to TO
be VB
patient JJ

and CC
to TO
wait VB
the DT
coming VBG
of IN
the DT
morning NN

Just NNP
as IN
I PRP
had VBD
come VBN
to TO
this DT
conclusion NN
I PRP
heard VBD
a DT
heavy JJ
step NN
approaching VBG
behind IN
the DT
great JJ
door NN
, ,
and CC
saw VBD
through IN
the DT
chinks NNS
the DT
gleam NN
of IN
a DT
coming VBG
light NN
. .
Then RB
there EX
was VBD
the DT
sound NN
of IN
rattling VBG
chains NNS
and CC
the DT
clanking NN
of IN
massive JJ
bolts NNS
drawn VBN
back RB

A DT
key NN
was VBD
turned VBN
with IN
the DT
loud JJ
grating NN
noise NN
of IN
long JJ
disuse NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
great JJ
door NN
swung NN
back RB

Within NNP
, ,
stood VBD
a DT
tall JJ
old JJ
man NN
, ,
clean JJ
shaven RB
save VBP
for IN
a DT
long JJ
white JJ
moustache NN

and CC
clad NN
in IN
black JJ
from IN
head NN
to TO
foot NN
, ,
without IN
a DT
single JJ
speck NN
of IN

about IN
him PRP
anywhere RB

He PRP
held VBD
in IN
his PRP$
hand NN
an DT
antique NN
silver NN
lamp NN
, ,
in IN
which WDT
the DT
flame NN
burned VBD
without IN

or CC
globe NN
of IN
any DT

, ,
throwing VBG
long JJ
quivering NN
shadows NNS
as IN
it PRP
flickered VBD
in IN
the DT
draught NN
of IN
the DT
open JJ

. .
The DT
old JJ
man NN
motioned VBD
me PRP
in IN
with IN
his PRP$
right JJ
hand NN
with IN
a DT
courtly RB
gesture NN
, ,
saying VBG
in IN
excellent JJ
English NNP

but CC
with IN
a DT
strange JJ
intonation NN
: :
'' ''

'' ''
He PRP
made VBD
no DT
motion NN
of IN
stepping VBG

meet VB
me PRP
, ,
but CC
stood VBD
like IN
a DT
statue NN
, ,
as IN
though IN
his PRP$
gesture NN
of IN

had VBD
fixed VBN
him PRP
into IN
stone NN

The DT
instant NN
, ,
however RB
, ,
that IN
I PRP
had VBD
stepped VBN
over IN
the DT

, ,
he PRP
moved VBD
impulsively RB
forward JJ

and CC
holding VBG
out RP
his PRP$

grasped VBD
mine NN
with IN
a DT
strength NN
which WDT
made VBD
me PRP
wince NN
, ,
an DT
effect NN
which WDT
was VBD
not RB
lessened VBN
by IN
the DT
fact NN
that IN
it PRP
seemed VBD
as RB
cold JJ
as IN
ice NN
more RBR
like IN
the DT
hand NN
of IN
a DT
dead JJ

a DT

Again CC
he PRP

: :
'' ''

'' ''
The DT
strength NN
of IN
the DT

was VBD
so RB
much JJ
akin NN
to TO
that DT
which WDT
I PRP

noticed VBN
in IN
the DT

whose WP$

I PRP
had VBD
not RB

that IN
for IN

I PRP
doubted VBD

not RB
the DT

to TO
whom WP
I PRP

so RB
to TO

I PRP
said VBD
interrogatively RB
: :
'' ''

He PRP

As IN

he PRP
put VBD
the DT
lamp NN
on IN
a DT
bracket NN
on IN
the DT
wall NN
, ,
and CC
stepping VBG
out RP

took VBD
my PRP$

he PRP

carried VBN
it PRP
in IN
before IN
I PRP

forestall VB
him PRP

I PRP
protested VBD

he PRP
insisted VBD
: :
'' ''

He PRP

carrying VBG
my PRP$

along IN
the DT

then RB
up RP
a DT

along IN
another DT

on IN

our PRP$

rang VBP
heavily RB

At IN
the DT

of IN
this DT
he PRP
threw VBD
open RP
a DT
heavy JJ

I PRP
rejoiced VBD

a DT

The DT
Count NNP
halted VBD

putting VBG
down RP
my PRP$

closed VBD
the DT

and CC
crossing VBG

seemingly RB

Passing VBG

he PRP

I PRP
began VBD
to TO
look VB
at IN
some DT
of IN
the DT

around IN

One CD
was VBD
an DT
atlas NN

which WDT
I PRP
found VBD
opened VBN
naturally RB
at IN
England NNP

as IN
if IN

On IN
looking VBG

it PRP
I PRP
found VBD
in IN
certain JJ
places NNS
little JJ

marked VBN

and CC
on IN
examining VBG
these DT
I PRP
noticed VBD
that IN
one CD

near IN
London NNP
on IN
the DT
east JJ

manifestly RB
where WRB
his PRP$
new JJ

situated VBN

the DT
other JJ
two CD

Exeter NNP

Whitby NNP
on IN

Yorkshire NNP

It PRP
was VBD
the DT
better JJR
part NN
of IN
an DT
hour NN
when WRB
the DT
Count NNP
returned VBD

`` ``

he PRP

`` ``

But CC

I PRP

'' ''
He PRP
took VBD
my PRP$

, ,
and CC
we PRP
went VBD
into IN
the DT
next JJ
room NN
, ,
where WRB
I PRP
found VBD
an DT
excellent JJ
supper NN
ready NN
on IN
the DT
table NN

The DT
Count NNP
again RB
excused VBD
himself PRP
, ,
as IN
he PRP
had VBD
dined VBN
out RP
on IN
his PRP$
being VBG
away RB

But CC
he PRP
sat VBD
as IN
on IN
the DT
previous JJ
night NN

chatted VBD
whilst NN
I PRP
ate VBP

After IN
supper NN
I PRP
smoked VBD
, ,
as IN
on IN
the DT
last JJ
evening NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
Count NNP
stayed VBD
with IN
me PRP

chatting VBG

asking VBG
questions NNS
on IN
every DT
conceivable JJ
subject NN
, ,
hour NN

I PRP
felt VBD
that IN
it PRP

very RB
late RB
indeed RB

but CC
I PRP
did VBD
not RB
say VB
anything NN

for IN
I PRP
felt VBD
under IN

meet VB
my PRP$

I PRP
was VBD
not RB
sleepy JJ

as IN
the DT

yesterday NN

fortified VBN
me PRP
; :
but CC
I PRP
could MD
not RB
help VB
experiencing VBG
that IN

which WDT

over IN
one CD
at IN
the DT

which WDT

in IN
its PRP$

the DT

They PRP

generally RB
at IN

the DT

any DT

experienced VBD
this DT

in IN

it PRP

All DT
at IN
once RB
we PRP
heard VBP
the DT
crow NN
of IN
a DT

coming VBG
up RP
with IN
preternatural JJ
shrillness NN
through IN
the DT
clear JJ
morning NN
air NN
; :
Count NNP
Dracula NNP

jumping VBG
to TO
his PRP$

said VBD
: :
'' ''
Why WRB

How WRB

I PRP

You PRP

my PRP$
dear JJ

less RBR

so IN
that IN
I PRP

how WRB

'' ''
and CC
, ,
with IN
a DT
courtly RB

he PRP
quickly RB
left VBD

I PRP
went VBD
into IN
my PRP$

drew VBD
the DT

but CC
there EX

little JJ
to TO
notice RB

my PRP$

all DT
I PRP

the DT
warm JJ
grey NN

So IN
I PRP
pulled VBD

again RB

I PRP

in IN
this DT

that IN

but CC
now RB
I PRP

glad JJ
that IN

for IN
there EX

something NN
so RB
strange JJ
about IN

all DT

it PRP
that IN

I PRP
wish VBP

It PRP

If IN
there EX

any DT

I PRP

but CC
there EX

no DT

I PRP

only RB
the DT

he PRP

I PRP

I PRP

myself PRP
the DT

Let VB

prosaic VBN

it PRP

If IN

I PRP

Let VB

how WRB

I PRP
only RB
slept VBD
a DT
few JJ
hours NNS
when WRB
I PRP
went VBD
to TO
bed NN
, ,
and CC
feeling VBG
that IN
I PRP

not RB
sleep VB
any DT
more JJR

got VBD
up RB

I PRP
had VBD
hung VBN
my PRP$
shaving VBG
glass NN
by IN
the DT

and CC
was VBD
just RB
beginning VBG
to TO

Suddenly RB
I PRP
felt VBD
a DT
hand NN
on IN
my PRP$
shoulder NN
, ,
and CC
heard VBD
the DT
Count NNP

voice NN
saying VBG
to TO
me PRP
, ,
`` ``
Good-morning NN

I PRP
started VBD

for IN
it PRP
amazed VBD
me PRP
that IN
I PRP

not RB

him PRP

since IN
the DT
reflection NN
of IN

covered VBD
the DT

In IN
starting VBG
I PRP

cut VBN
myself PRP
slightly RB

but CC
did VBD
not RB
notice VB
it PRP
at IN
the DT
moment NN

Having VBG
answered VBD
the DT
Count's NNP
salutation NN
, ,
I PRP
turned VBD
to TO
the DT
glass NN
again RB
to TO
see VB
how WRB
I PRP
had VBD
been VBN
mistaken VBN

This DT
time NN
there EX

be VB
no DT

, ,
for IN
the DT
man NN
was VBD
close JJ
to TO
me PRP

and CC
I PRP
could MD
see VB
him PRP
over IN
my PRP$
shoulder NN

But CC
there EX
was VBD
no DT

him PRP
in IN
the DT
mirror NN

The DT
whole JJ
room NN
behind IN
me PRP

but CC
there EX
was VBD
no DT

of IN
a DT
man NN
in IN
it PRP

except IN
myself PRP

This DT
was VBD
startling VBG
, ,
and CC
, ,
coming VBG
on IN
the DT
top NN
of IN
so RB
many JJ
strange JJ
things NNS

was VBD
beginning VBG
to TO
increase VB
that DT
vague JJ
feeling NN
of IN
uneasiness NN
which WDT
I PRP
always RB
have VBP
when WRB
the DT
Count NNP
is VBZ
near IN

but CC
at IN
the DT
instant NN
I PRP
saw VBD
that IN
the DT
cut NN
had VBD
bled VBN
a DT
little JJ

and CC
the DT
blood NN
was VBD
trickling VBG
over IN
my PRP$
chin NN

I PRP
laid VBD
down RB
the DT
razor NN
, ,
turning VBG
as IN
I PRP
did VBD
so RB
half JJ
round NN
to TO
look VB
for IN
some DT
sticking NN
plaster NN

When WRB
the DT
Count NNP
saw VBD
my PRP$
face NN
, ,
his PRP$
eyes NNS
blazed VBN
with IN
a DT
sort NN
of IN
demoniac JJ
fury NN
, ,
and CC
he PRP
suddenly RB
made VBD
a DT
grab NN
at IN
my PRP$
throat NN

I PRP
drew VBD
away RB
, ,
and CC
his PRP$
hand NN
touched VBD
the DT
string NN
of IN
beads NNS
which WDT
held VBD
the DT
crucifix NN

It PRP
made VBD
an DT
instant JJ
change NN
in IN
him PRP
, ,
for IN
the DT
fury NN
passed VBD
so RB
quickly RB
that IN
I PRP
could MD
hardly RB
believe VB
that IN
it PRP
was VBD
ever RB
there RB

`` ``
Take NNP

he PRP

`` ``

how WRB

It PRP

Then RB
seizing VBG
the DT
shaving NN
glass NN

he PRP
went VBD
on IN

`` ``

opening VBG
the DT

with IN
one CD

he PRP
flung VBD

shattered VBN
into IN
a DT

pieces NNS
on IN
the DT

Then RB
he PRP
withdrew VBD

It PRP

very RB
annoying JJ

breakfast NN

I PRP

not RB

So IN

It PRP

He PRP

After IN

I PRP

I PRP

out RP

A DT

As RB

CHAPTER NN

JOURNAL NNP
continued VBD
When WRB
I PRP
found VBD
that IN
I PRP
was VBD
a DT
prisoner NN
a DT
sort NN
of IN
wild JJ
feeling NN
came VBD
over IN
me PRP

I PRP
rushed VBD
up RB
and CC
down IN
the DT
stairs NNS
, ,
trying VBG
every DT

and CC
peering VBG
out IN
of IN
every DT
window NN
I PRP
could MD
find VB
; :
but CC
after IN
a DT
little JJ
the DT
conviction NN
of IN
my PRP$
helplessness NN
overpowered VBN
all DT
other JJ
feelings NNS

When WRB
I PRP
look VBP
back RB
after IN
a DT
few JJ
hours NNS
I PRP
think VBP
I PRP
must MD
have VB
been VBN
mad JJ
for IN
the DT
time NN
, ,
for IN
I PRP
behaved VBD
much RB
as IN
a DT

When WRB
, ,
however RB
, ,
the DT
conviction NN
had VBD
come VBN
to TO
me PRP
that IN
I PRP
was VBD
helpless JJ
I PRP
sat VBD
down RB
quietly RB
as RB
quietly RB
as IN
I PRP
have VBP
ever RB
done VBN
anything NN
in IN
my PRP$

and CC
began VBD

think VB
over IN
what WP

I PRP
am VBP
thinking VBG

and CC
as IN
yet RB
have VBP
come VBN
to TO
no DT

Of IN
one CD
thing NN
only RB

I PRP
certain JJ
; :
that IN
it PRP

no DT

making VBG
my PRP$

He PRP

that IN

as IN
he PRP

it PRP

doubtless VBN
his PRP$

motives NNS

, ,
he PRP
would MD
only RB
deceive VB
me PRP
if IN
I PRP
trusted VBD
him PRP
fully RB

So RB
far RB
as IN
I PRP
can MD
see VB

my PRP$
only JJ
plan NN
will MD
be VB
to TO
keep VB
my PRP$

I PRP

I PRP

either DT

I PRP

and CC
if IN

, ,
I PRP
need VBP

and CC

, ,
all DT
my PRP$
brains NNS
to TO
get VB

I PRP
had VBD
hardly RB
come VBN
to TO
this DT
conclusion NN
when WRB
I PRP
heard VBD
the DT
great JJ
door NN
below IN
shut NN

and CC
knew VBD
that IN
the DT
Count NNP

He PRP
did VBD
not RB
come VBN

into IN

so IN
I PRP
went VBD
cautiously RB
to TO
my PRP$

and CC
found VBD
him PRP
making VBG
the DT

This DT
was VBD
odd JJ

but CC
only RB
confirmed VBD
what WP
I PRP
had VBD
all DT
along RB
thought VBN
that IN
there EX

no DT

When WRB
later RBR
I PRP
saw VBD
him PRP
through IN
the DT

laying VBG

in IN

I PRP

all PDT

surely RB
it PRP

proof JJ
that IN
there EX

This DT
gave VBD
me PRP
a DT
fright NN

for IN
if IN
there EX

no DT

in IN
the DT

it PRP
must MD
have VB

the DT
Count NNP
himself PRP
who WP

the DT

of IN

that WDT

This DT
is VBZ
a DT
terrible JJ

for IN

so RB

what WP
does VBZ
it PRP
mean VB
that IN
he PRP

the DT
wolves NNS

as IN
he PRP

by IN

in IN

How WRB

it PRP
that IN

some DT

What WP

I PRP

in IN

The DT

With IN

I PRP

As IN

I PRP

There EX

When WRB

Then RB

Finally RB

Somewhere RB

I PRP

The DT

None NN

There EX

some DT

but CC
all DT

old JJ

At IN
one CD
corner NN
of IN
the DT

was VBD
a DT
heavy JJ

I PRP
tried VBD
it PRP
, ,
for IN
, ,
since IN
I PRP
could MD
not RB
find VB
the DT
key NN
of IN
the DT

or CC
the DT

of IN
the DT

which WDT

the DT

I PRP
must MD
make VB

or CC
all DT

It PRP
was VBD
open JJ

led VBD
through IN
a DT
stone NN
passage NN
to TO
a DT
circular JJ

which WDT
went VBD
steeply RB
down RB

I PRP
descended VBD

minding VBG
carefully RB
where WRB
I PRP
went VBD

for IN
the DT
stairs NNS
were VBD
dark JJ

being VBG
only RB
lit VBN
by IN

At IN
the DT
bottom NN
there EX

a DT
dark JJ

tunnel-like JJ

through IN
which WDT
came VBD
a DT
deathly NN

sickly RB

the DT
odour NN

newly RB

As IN
I PRP
went VBD
through IN
the DT

the DT

grew VBD
closer JJR

At IN
last JJ
I PRP
pulled VBD
open RP
a DT
heavy JJ
door NN
which WDT
stood VBD
ajar NNS

found VBD
myself PRP
in IN
an DT
old JJ

ruined VBD
chapel NN

which WDT

evidently RB
been VBN
used VBN
as IN

The DT
roof NN

broken VBN

and CC
in IN
two CD

but CC
the DT

had VBD
recently RB

dug NN
over IN

and CC
the DT
earth NN
placed VBN
in IN
great JJ
wooden JJ

manifestly RB
those DT
which WDT

been VBN
brought VBN

There EX

nobody NN

and CC
I PRP
made VBD
search NN
for IN
any DT

but CC
there RB
was VBD
none NN

Then RB
I PRP
went VBD
over IN
every DT

so RB
as IN
not RB
to TO

a DT

I PRP

although IN
to TO

a DT

Into NNP
two CD

I PRP
went VBD

but CC

in IN
the DT

however RB

I PRP
made VBD
a DT

There EX

in IN
one CD

which WDT
there EX

without IN

But CC
there EX

no DT

no DT

no DT

I PRP
bent VBP
over IN
him PRP

in IN

He PRP

for IN

By IN

I PRP

when WRB

I PRP

such PDT
a DT

As IN

He PRP

Without IN

It PRP

that DT

I PRP

not RB

but CC
the DT

I PRP
went VBD
through IN

down IN

along IN

I PRP

The DT

the DT

with IN

I PRP

so IN
I PRP
raised VBD
the DT

back RP

and CC
then RB
I PRP

something NN
which WDT
filled VBD
my PRP$

soul NN
with IN
horror NN

There EX
lay VBZ
the DT
Count NNP

but CC
looking VBG
as IN
if IN

been VBN
half JJ

the DT

and CC
the DT

ruby-red JJ
underneath NN
; :
the DT
mouth NN
was VBD
redder JJR
than IN
ever RB
, ,
for IN
on IN
the DT
lips NNS
were VBD
gouts NNS
of IN
fresh JJ
blood NN
, ,
which WDT
trickled VBD
from IN
the DT
corners NNS
of IN
the DT
mouth NN
and CC
ran NN
over IN
the DT
chin NN
and CC
neck NN
. .
Even RB
the DT
deep NN
, ,
burning VBG
eyes NNS
seemed VBD
set JJ
amongst NN
swollen NN
flesh NN
, ,
for IN
the DT
lids NNS
and CC

bloated VBN

It PRP
seemed VBD
as IN
if IN
the DT

simply RB
gorged VBN

He PRP
lay VBD
like IN

exhausted VBN
with IN

I PRP
shuddered VBD
as IN
I PRP
bent VBP
over IN

touch VB
him PRP
, ,
and CC
every DT
sense NN
in IN
me PRP
revolted VBD
at IN
the DT

; :
but CC
I PRP
had VBD
to TO
search VB
, ,
or CC
I PRP
was VBD
lost VBN

The DT
coming VBG
night NN
might MD
see VB
my PRP$

body NN
a DT
banquet NN
in IN
a DT
similar JJ
way NN
to TO
those DT

I PRP
felt VBD
all DT
over IN
the DT
body NN
, ,
but CC
no DT
sign NN
could MD
I PRP
find VB

the DT

. .
Then RB
I PRP
stopped VBD
and CC
looked VBD
at IN
the DT
Count NNP

There EX
was VBD
a DT
mocking NN
smile NN
on IN
the DT
bloated JJ
face NN
which WDT
seemed VBD
to TO
drive VB
me PRP
mad JJ
. .
This DT
was VBD
the DT
being VBG
I PRP
was VBD
helping VBG
to TO
transfer VB
to TO
London NNP
, ,
where WRB
, ,
perhaps RB
, ,
for IN
centuries NNS

he PRP
might MD
, ,
amongst VB

satiate VB
his PRP$

and CC
create VB
a DT
new JJ
and CC
ever-widening JJ
circle NN
of IN
semi-demons NNS
to TO
batten VB
on IN
the DT
helpless NN
. .
The DT
very RB
thought JJ
drove VB
me PRP
mad JJ
. .
A DT
terrible JJ
desire NN
came VBD
upon IN
me PRP
to TO
rid VB
the DT
world NN
of IN
such JJ
a DT
monster NN
. .
There EX
was VBD
no DT
lethal JJ
weapon NN
at IN
hand NN
, ,
but CC
I PRP
seized VBD
a DT
shovel NN
which WDT
the DT
workmen NNS
had VBD
been VBN
using VBG
to TO
fill VB
the DT
cases NNS
, ,
and CC
lifting VBG
it PRP
high JJ
, ,
struck VBD
, ,
with IN
the DT
edge NN
downward RB
, ,
at IN
the DT
hateful JJ
face NN

But CC
as IN
I PRP
did VBD
so RB
the DT
head NN
turned VBD
, ,
and CC
the DT
eyes NNS
fell VBD
full JJ
upon IN
me PRP
, ,
with IN
all DT
their PRP$
blaze NN
of IN
basilisk JJ
horror NN

The DT
sight NN
seemed VBD
to TO
paralyse VB
me PRP
, ,
and CC
the DT
shovel NN
turned VBD
in IN
my PRP$
hand NN
and CC
glanced VBN
from IN
the DT
face NN
, ,
merely RB
making VBG
a DT
deep JJ
gash NN
above IN
the DT
forehead NN

The DT
shovel NN
fell VBD
from IN
my PRP$
hand NN
across IN
the DT
box NN
, ,
and CC
as IN
I PRP
pulled VBD
it PRP
away RP
the DT
flange NN
of IN
the DT
blade NN
caught VBD
the DT
edge NN
of IN
the DT
lid NN
which WDT
fell VBD
over RB
again RB
, ,
and CC
hid VBZ
the DT
horrid JJ
thing NN
from IN
my PRP$
sight NN

The DT
last JJ
glimpse NN
I PRP
had VBD
was VBD
of IN
the DT
bloated JJ
face NN
, ,
blood-stained JJ
and CC
fixed VBN
with IN
a DT
grin NN
of IN
malice NN
which WDT
would MD
have VB
held VBN
its PRP$

in IN
the DT
nethermost NN
hell NN

I PRP
thought VBD
and CC
thought VBD
what WP

my PRP$

but CC
my PRP$
brain NN
seemed VBD
on IN
fire NN
, ,
and CC
I PRP
waited VBD
with IN
a DT
despairing VBG
feeling NN
growing NN
over IN

As IN
I PRP
waited VBD
I PRP
heard VBP
in IN
the DT
distance NN
a DT
gipsy NN
song NN
sung NN
by IN
merry JJ
voices NNS
coming VBG
closer RB
, ,
and CC
through IN
their PRP$
song NN
the DT
rolling NN
of IN
heavy JJ

and CC
the DT
cracking NN
of IN

; :
the DT
Szgany NNP
and CC
the DT
Slovaks NNP
of IN
whom WP
the DT
Count NNP
had VBD
spoken VBN
were VBD
coming VBG

With IN
a DT
last JJ
look NN
around RB
and CC
at IN
the DT
box NN
which WDT
contained VBD
the DT
vile NN
body NN
, ,
I PRP
ran VBP
from IN

and CC
gained VBD
the DT
Count's NNP
room NN

determined VBD
to TO
rush VB
out RP

the DT
moment NN
the DT

With IN
strained JJ
ears NNS

I PRP
listened VBD

and CC
heard RB
downstairs VBZ
the DT
grinding NN
of IN
the DT

in IN
the DT
great JJ

and CC
the DT
falling VBG
back NN
of IN

There EX

some DT

or CC
some DT
one CD

a DT

Then RB
there EX
came VBD
the DT
sound NN
of IN

tramping VBG

dying VBG
away RB
in IN
some DT
passage NN
which WDT
sent VBD
up RP
a DT

I PRP

run VB
down RP

towards IN

where WRB
I PRP

but CC
at IN
the DT
moment NN
there RB
seemed VBD

come VB
a DT
violent JJ
puff NN
of IN
wind NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
door NN
to TO
the DT
winding VBG
stair NN
blew VBD
to TO
with IN
a DT
shock NN
that WDT
set VBD
the DT

When WRB
I PRP
ran VBD

I PRP
found VBD
that IN

hopelessly RB

I PRP

and CC
the DT

more RBR

As IN
I PRP

there EX

There EX

Now RB

The DT

I PRP

We PRP

such JJ
an DT

such PDT

I PRP
fell VBD

my PRP$

Suddenly RB
I PRP

broad JJ

sat VBD
up RP

with IN
a DT
horrible JJ
sense NN

upon IN

of IN
some DT

The DT

dark JJ

so IN
I PRP

not RB

Lucy NNP

I PRP
stole VBP

The DT

empty JJ

I PRP
lit VBD
a DT

found VBD
that IN

not RB

The DT

was VBD
shut VBN

but CC
not RB

as IN

I PRP

who WP

been VBN
more JJR

so RB
threw VBD

some DT

As IN
I PRP

it PRP
struck VBD
me PRP
that IN

some DT
clue NN

Dressing-gown NNP

Dressing-gown JJ

both DT

`` ``

I PRP

I PRP

downstairs NNS

Not RB

Then RB
I PRP
looked VBD
in IN
all PDT
the DT

with IN
an DT
ever-growing JJ

my PRP$

Finally RB
I PRP
came VBD
to TO
the DT

it PRP
open JJ

It PRP

not RB
wide JJ
open JJ

the DT

The DT
people NNS

careful JJ

every DT

so IN
I PRP
feared VBD
that IN

out RP

There EX

no DT

a DT

I PRP
took VBD
a DT
big JJ

heavy JJ

out RP

The DT

one CD

there RB

I PRP

North NNP

but CC

no DT

At IN
the DT

West NNP

I PRP

I PRP

which WDT

Lucy NNP

There EX

a DT

which WDT

the DT
whole JJ
scene NN
into IN
a DT
fleeting JJ
diorama NN
of IN

as IN

For IN
a DT
moment NN

two CD
I PRP

nothing NN

as IN
the DT
shadow NN

a DT

St. NNP

all DT

Then RB
as IN
the DT
cloud NN
passed VBD
I PRP

see VB
the DT

as IN
the DT
edge NN

a DT

the DT

the DT

Whatever WDT

it PRP

not RB
disappointed JJ

for IN
there RB

on IN
our PRP$

the DT
silver NN
light NN
of IN
the DT

a DT
half-reclining JJ

snowy JJ
white JJ

The DT

too RB

for IN

shut VBP

almost RB

but CC
it PRP

something NN
dark NN

What WP

I PRP

I PRP

down IN

along RB

the DT
fish-market NN
to TO
the DT

which WDT

the DT
only JJ
way NN

the DT
East NNP

The DT

for IN

a DT

I PRP
rejoiced VBD
that IN
it PRP

for IN
I PRP
wanted VBD
no DT

Lucy NNP

The DT

endless JJ

my PRP$

my PRP$
breath NN
came VBD
laboured VBN
as IN

toiled VBD
up RP
the DT
endless JJ

I PRP
must MD
have VB

it PRP

weighted VBN

When WRB

almost RB

the DT

I PRP

the DT

close RB
enough JJ

even RB

There EX

undoubtedly RB
something NN

black JJ

bending VBG

white JJ

I PRP
called VBD

`` ``

something NN
raised VBD
a DT

from IN

I PRP

a DT
white JJ

Lucy NNP
did VBD
not RB
answer VB

and CC
I PRP
ran VBP
on IN

the DT

As IN

the DT

between IN

the DT

for IN
a DT

so RB
I PRP
lost VBD

When WRB
I PRP
came VBD
in IN

again RB
the DT
cloud NN

the DT
moonlight JJ

so RB
brilliantly RB
that IN
I PRP

Lucy NNP
half NN
reclining VBG

her PRP$

over IN

She PRP

quite RB

there RB

not RB
a DT

When WRB
I PRP
bent VBP
over IN
her PRP$
I PRP

see VB
that IN
she PRP

still RB
asleep JJ

Her PRP$
lips NNS
were VBD
parted VBN

she PRP
was VBD
breathing VBG
not RB
softly RB

in IN

heavy JJ

As IN

she PRP
put VBD
up RP
her PRP$

in IN

pulled VBD
the DT

Whilst NNP
she PRP

so RB
there RB
came VBD
a DT
little JJ

as IN

I PRP
flung VBP
the DT

drew VBD
the DT

tight VBD
round RP
her PRP$

for IN
I PRP
dreaded VBD

get VB
some DT
deadly RB

the DT
night NN
air NN

unclad JJ
as IN
she PRP

I PRP
feared VBD

all DT

so RB
, ,
in IN
order NN
to TO
have VB
my PRP$
hands NNS
free VBP
that IN
I PRP

help VB
her PRP

I PRP
fastened VBD
the DT

at IN
her PRP$
throat NN
with IN
a DT
big JJ
safety-pin NN

but CC
I PRP
must MD
have VB
been VBN
clumsy VBN
in IN
my PRP$
anxiety NN

pinched VBD

pricked VBD
her PRP

it PRP

for IN
by-and-by NN

when WRB
her PRP$

quieter RB

she PRP
put VBD
her PRP

again RB

When WRB
I PRP

her PRP
carefully RB

I PRP
put VBP
my PRP$

then RB

very RB
gently RB

At IN
first JJ
she PRP

not RB

but CC
gradually RB
she PRP
became VBD
more RBR

more JJR
uneasy JJ
in IN

moaning VBG

occasionally RB

At IN

as IN

for IN

I PRP

I PRP

finally RB

She PRP

she PRP

Lucy NNP
always RB

even RB
at IN
such PDT
a DT

when WRB
her PRP$

chilled VBN
with IN

her PRP$
mind NN
somewhat RB
appalled VBD
at IN
waking VBG
unclad JJ
in IN
a DT

at IN

she PRP
did VBD
not RB
lose VB
her PRP$

She PRP
trembled VBD
a DT
little JJ

to TO
me PRP

when WRB
I PRP
told VBD
her PRP

come VB
at IN

with IN
me PRP
home NN
she PRP
rose VBD
without IN
a DT

with IN
the DT
obedience NN
of IN

As IN
we PRP

along RB

the DT
gravel NN
hurt VBD
my PRP$

and CC
Lucy NNP
noticed VBD
me PRP

She PRP

I PRP

However RB

when WRB
we PRP

the DT

where WRB
there EX

I PRP

using VBG

Fortune NNP

we PRP

Once IN

we PRP

My PRP$

so IN

all PDT
the DT

that IN
sometimes RB
I PRP

I PRP

not RB

for IN

When WRB
we PRP

I PRP

Before IN

her PRP$

I PRP

how WRB
the DT

I PRP

I PRP

I PRP

Chasing VBG

He PRP

by IN
Lucy NNP

her PRP$

so RB
that IN

Van NNP
Helsing NNP
made VBD

He PRP

I PRP

He PRP

I PRP

much RB

he PRP

When WRB

how WRB

I PRP
asked VBD
what WP
he PRP
meant VB
by IN
that DT

for IN
he PRP
was VBD
very RB
serious JJ

This DT
was VBD
when WRB

he PRP
was VBD
having VBG
a DT

He PRP

You PRP

not RB

angry JJ

Art NNP

He PRP

speak VB
plainly RB

when WRB

So RB
I PRP

I PRP

Van NNP

Then RB

standing VBG

looking VBG

when WRB

As IN

I PRP

It PRP

even RB

my PRP$

all DT

I PRP
reached VBD
him PRP
just RB
as IN
the DT
sun NN
was VBD
going VBG
down RB
, ,
and CC
from IN
his PRP$
window NN
saw VBD
the DT

As IN

sank VBD
he PRP
became VBD
less RBR

less RBR
frenzied VBN

just RB
as IN

dipped VBD
he PRP
slid VBD
from IN
the DT

that WDT

him PRP

an DT

on IN

It PRP

however RB

what WP

for IN
within IN

minutes NNS
he PRP
stood VBD
up RP
quite RB
calmly RB

looked VBD
around IN
him PRP

I PRP
signalled VBD

not RB

him PRP

for IN
I PRP
was VBD
anxious JJ

what WP

He PRP
went VBD
straight RB
over IN

the DT
window NN

brushed VBD
out RP
the DT
crumbs NN

then RB
he PRP

his PRP$

emptied VBD
it PRP

then RB
he PRP
shut VBD
the DT

crossing VBG
over RP

sat VBD
down RP

All PDT
this DT
surprised VBD

so IN
I PRP
asked VBD
him PRP
: :
`` ``

The DT

worked VBD
itself PRP
off RP

dusk NN

and CC
she PRP
waked VBD
naturally RB

she PRP
looked VBD
a DT
different JJ
being VBG
from IN
what WP
she PRP

been VBN
before IN

Her PRP$

she PRP

full JJ

but CC
I PRP
could MD
see VB
evidences NNS
of IN
the DT
absolute NN
prostration NN
which WDT

When WRB
I PRP
told VBD
Mrs. NNP

directed VBN
that IN
I PRP

her PRP$
she PRP
almost RB
pooh-poohed VBD
the DT

pointing VBG

renewed VBN

excellent JJ

I PRP

firm NN

When WRB

I PRP

She PRP

gratefully RB
whenever WRB
I PRP
caught VBD
her PRP

After IN
a DT

she PRP
seemed VBD
sinking VBG
off RP

with IN

This DT

It PRP

apparent JJ
that IN

The DT

The DT

My PRP$

They PRP

The DT

September NNP

I PRP
drove VBD

once RB
to TO
Hillingham NNP

arrived VBD
early RB

Keeping VBG
my PRP$
cab NN
at IN
the DT

, ,
I PRP
went VBD
up RP
the DT
avenue NN
alone RB

I PRP
knocked VBD
gently RB
and CC
rang VB
as RB
quietly RB
as IN
possible JJ
, ,
for IN
I PRP
feared VBD
to TO
disturb VB
Lucy NNP
or CC
her PRP$
mother NN
, ,
and CC
hoped VBD
to TO
only RB
bring VB
a DT

to TO

After IN
a DT
while NN
, ,
finding VBG
no DT

, ,
I PRP
knocked VBD
and CC
rang VB
again RB

still RB
no DT

I PRP
cursed VBD
the DT
laziness NN
of IN
the DT

that IN
they PRP

lie VB
abed VBN
at IN
such PDT
an DT
hour NN
for IN
it PRP

now RB
ten JJ
o'clock NN
and CC
so RB
rang JJ

knocked VBD

but CC
more RBR
impatiently RB
, ,
but CC
still RB
without IN
response NN

Hitherto NNP
I PRP
had VBD
blamed VBN
only RB
the DT
servants NNS
, ,
but CC
now RB
a DT
terrible JJ
fear NN
began VBD
to TO
assail VB
me PRP

Was VB
this DT
desolation NN
but CC
another DT
link NN
in IN
the DT
chain NN
of IN
doom NN
which WDT
seemed VBD
drawing VBG
tight NN
around IN
us PRP

Was VBD
it PRP
indeed RB
a DT
house NN
of IN
death NN
to TO
which WDT
I PRP
had VBD
come VBN
, ,
too RB
late JJ

I PRP
knew VBD
that IN
minutes NNS
, ,
even RB
seconds NNS
of IN

might MD
mean VB
hours NNS
of IN
danger NN
to TO
Lucy NNP
, ,
if IN
she PRP
had VBD
had VBN
again RB
one CD
of IN
those DT
frightful JJ
relapses NNS

and CC
I PRP
went VBD
round IN
the DT

to TO
try VB

I PRP
could MD
find VB
by IN
chance NN
an DT
entry NN
anywhere RB

I PRP
could MD
find VB
no DT

of IN

Every DT

was VBD
fastened VBN
and CC
locked VBN

and CC
I PRP
returned VBD
baffled VBN

the DT

As IN
I PRP
did VBD
so RB
, ,
I PRP
heard VBD
the DT
rapid JJ
pit-pat NN
of IN
a DT

horse NN

They PRP
stopped VBD
at IN

and CC
a DT

seconds NNS

I PRP
met VBD

Helsing NNP
running VBG

When WRB

he PRP
gasped VBD

Did NNP

'' ''
I PRP

coherently RB
as IN
I PRP

that IN

early RB
in IN
the DT

and CC
that IN

He PRP
paused VBD

With IN

`` ``

We PRP

round NN
to TO
the DT
back NN
of IN
the DT

where WRB
there EX
was VBD
a DT

The DT
Professor NNP
took VBD
a DT
small JJ

and CC
handing VBG
it PRP
to TO
me PRP
, ,
pointed VBD
to TO
the DT
iron NN
bars NNS
which WDT
guarded VBD
the DT

I PRP
attacked VBD
them PRP
at IN
once RB
and CC
had VBD
very RB
soon RB
cut VBD
through IN
three CD

them PRP

Then RB
with IN
a DT
long JJ

thin JJ
knife NN
we PRP
pushed VBD
back RP
the DT

opened VBD

I PRP
helped VBD
the DT
Professor NNP
in IN

and CC
followed VBD
him PRP

There EX
was VBD
no DT

in IN
the DT

or CC
in IN
the DT

which WDT

We PRP
tried VBD
all PDT
the DT

as IN
we PRP
went VBD
along RB

and CC
in IN
the DT
dining-room NN
, ,
dimly RB
lit VBN
by IN

through IN

found VBD
four CD

lying VBG
on IN

There EX
was VBD
no DT

to TO
think VB
them PRP
dead JJ

for IN
their PRP$
stertorous JJ
breathing NN
and CC
the DT
acrid JJ
smell NN
of IN
laudanum NN
in IN
the DT

left VBD
no DT

as IN
to TO
their PRP$

Van NNP
Helsing NNP

I PRP
looked VBD
at IN
each DT

as IN
we PRP
moved VBD
away RB
he PRP
said VBD

`` ``

Then RB
we PRP
ascended VBD
to TO
Lucy NNP

For IN
an DT
instant JJ
or CC
two CD
we PRP
paused VBD
at IN
the DT

to TO

but CC
there EX
was VBD
no DT

that IN

With IN
white JJ

trembling VBG

we PRP
opened VBD
the DT

gently RB

and CC
entered VBD
the DT

How WRB

I PRP
describe VB
what WP
we PRP
saw VBD

On IN
the DT
bed NN
lay VBD
two CD
women NNS

Lucy NNP
and CC
her PRP$
mother NN

The DT
latter JJ
lay NN
farthest JJS
in IN

and CC
she PRP
was VBD
covered VBN
with IN
a DT
white JJ
sheet NN

the DT

of IN
which WDT

been VBN
blown VBN
back RB
by IN

through IN

showing VBG
the DT

with IN
a DT

By IN

lay NN
Lucy NNP

with IN

white JJ

still RB
more JJR
drawn NN

The DT
flowers NNS
which WDT

been VBN
round VBN
her PRP$

we PRP
found VBD
upon IN
her PRP$
mother NN

her PRP$

was VBD
bare JJ

showing VBG
the DT
two CD

wounds NNS
which WDT
we PRP
had VBD
noticed VBN
before IN

but CC
looking VBG
horribly RB
white JJ
and CC
mangled VBN

Without IN
a DT

the DT
Professor NNP
bent NN
over IN
the DT
bed NN
, ,
his PRP$
head NN
almost RB
touching JJ
poor JJ
Lucy NNP

then RB
he PRP
gave VBD
a DT

as IN

I PRP

the DT

which WDT
I PRP

The DT
maids NNS
were VBD
still RB
breathing VBG

but CC
more JJR
restlessly RB
, ,
and CC
I PRP
fancied VBD
that IN
the DT
narcotic NN
was VBD
wearing VBG
off RP

I PRP
did VBD
not RB
stay VB
to TO
make VB

but CC

Van NNP
Helsing NNP

He PRP
rubbed VBD
the DT

as IN

another DT

the DT

He PRP

a DT

This DT

more JJR

'' ''
I PRP
went VBD
at IN
once RB
, ,
and CC
found VBD
little JJ
difficulty NN
in IN
waking VBG
three CD
of IN
the DT
women NNS

The DT
fourth JJ
was VBD
only RB
a DT
young JJ
girl NN

and CC
the DT
drug NN
had VBD
evidently RB
affected VBN
her PRP
more RBR
strongly RB

so IN
I PRP
lifted VBD
her PRP
on IN
the DT
sofa NN

let VB
her PRP$
sleep NN

The DT

were VBD
dazed VBN
at IN

but CC
as IN

came VBD
back RB

them PRP
they PRP
cried VBD

I PRP
was VBD
stern JJ
with IN
them PRP

however RB

would MD
not RB
let VB

I PRP
told VBD
them PRP
that IN
one CD
life NN

bad JJ
enough RB
to TO

and CC
that IN
if IN
they PRP
delayed VBD
they PRP

Miss NNP
Lucy NNP

So RB

sobbing VBG

crying VBG

they PRP
went VBD
about IN
their PRP$
way NN

half NN

as IN
they PRP

Fortunately RB

the DT

still RB
alive JJ

and CC
there EX

no DT

We PRP
got VBD
a DT

and CC
carried VBD
Lucy NNP
out RP
as IN
she PRP

placed VBD
her PRP$
in IN
it PRP

Whilst IN
we PRP

busy JJ
chafing VBG
her PRP$

there EX

a DT

One CD

ran VBD

hurried VBN

some DT

opened VBD

Then RB
she PRP

whispered VBD

that IN
there EX

who WP

I PRP

She PRP

engrossed VBN

I PRP

I PRP
never RB

I PRP

a DT

death NN

in IN
a DT
pause NN
told VBD
him PRP

He PRP
answered VBD
me PRP

that IN
I PRP

not RB

with IN
the DT
sternest JJS

He PRP

renewed VBN

more RBR
frenzied JJ

Presently RB
we PRP
both DT
began VBD
to TO
be VB
conscious JJ
that IN
the DT

beginning VBG

Lucy NNP

beat VBD
a DT
trifle RB
more RBR
audibly RB
to TO

her PRP$

Van NNP
Helsing's NNP

rolled VBD

I PRP

the DT

Her PRP$

The DT

When WRB

the DT

The DT

Professor NNP

where WRB
it PRP

lest JJS

Doubtless NNP

somewhat NN

she PRP

very RB
low JJ
in IN

something NN

I PRP

When WRB

At IN

I PRP

the DT

Whilst JJ

stronger JJR

her PRP$

thus RB

longer RBR

when WRB

the DT

In IN

Quincey NNP

the DT

When WRB

Arthur NNP

none NN

In IN

the DT

the DT

Arthur NNP

At IN

Arthur NNP

fallen VBN

he PRP
mercifully RB
let VBD

When WRB

Lucy NNP

I PRP

hear VB
the DT
sissing VBG

of IN
his PRP$

he PRP

in IN
a DT
sharp JJ

`` ``

Then RB
he PRP

with IN
his PRP$

almost RB
touching VBG
Lucy NNP

examined VBD

He PRP
removed VBD
the DT

lifted VBD
the DT
silk NN

from IN

As IN
he PRP
did VBD
so RB
he PRP
started VBD
back RB

and CC
I PRP
could MD
hear VB
his PRP$
ejaculation NN

`` ``

as IN
it PRP

smothered VBN
in IN

I PRP

too RB

as IN
I PRP

some DT
queer NN
chill NN
came VBD
over IN

The DT

absolutely RB
disappeared VBN

For IN
fully RB
five CD

Van NNP
Helsing NNP
stood VBD
looking VBG
at IN
her PRP

with IN
his PRP$

at IN
its PRP$
sternest JJS

Then RB
he PRP
turned VBD

said VBD
calmly NN
: :
'' ''

'' ''
I PRP
went VBD
to TO
the DT

waked VBD
him PRP

He PRP
was VBD
dazed VBN
for IN
a DT
moment NN

but CC
when WRB
he PRP
saw VBD
the DT
sunlight JJ
streaming NN
in IN
through IN
the DT
edges NNS

he PRP
thought VBD
he PRP

late JJ

expressed VBD
his PRP$
fear NN

I PRP
assured VBD
him PRP
that IN
Lucy NNP

still RB
asleep JJ

but CC
told VBD
him PRP
as RB
gently RB
as IN
I PRP
could MD
that IN
both DT
Van NNP
Helsing NNP

I PRP
feared VBD
that IN
the DT

near RB

He PRP
covered VBD
his PRP$
face NN
with IN
his PRP$
hands NNS

and CC
slid VBD
down RB
on IN
his PRP$
knees NNS
by IN
the DT
sofa NN

where WRB
he PRP
remained VBD

perhaps RB
a DT
minute NN

with IN
his PRP$
head NN
buried VBD

praying VBG

whilst VB
his PRP$
shoulders NNS
shook VBP

grief NN

I PRP
took VBD
him PRP
by IN
the DT
hand NN
and CC
raised VBD
him PRP
up RP

`` ``

I PRP
said VBD

`` ``

When WRB
we PRP
came VBD
into IN
Lucy NNP

I PRP

see VB
that IN
Van NNP

had VBD

with IN
his PRP$
usual JJ

been VBN
putting VBG
matters NNS
straight JJ

making VBG
everything NN
look NN

as IN

He PRP
had VBD
even RB
brushed VBN
Lucy's NNP

so IN
that IN
it PRP
lay VBD
on IN
the DT

in IN
its PRP$

sunny JJ

When WRB
we PRP

she PRP
opened VBD
her PRP

seeing VBG
him PRP

whispered VBD
softly RB

He PRP

when WRB

`` ``

So IN
Arthur NNP
took VBD

she PRP

Then RB
gradually RB
her PRP$

For IN

her PRP$

her PRP$

And CC
then RB
insensibly RB
there EX

the DT
strange JJ

which WDT

Her PRP$

grew VBD
stertorous JJ

the DT

opened VBD

the DT

drawn VBN

made VBD

sharper RBR

In IN
a DT

unconscious JJ

she PRP

now RB
dull JJ

hard JJ
at IN
once RB

said VBD

such JJ

Arthur NNP

at IN

who WP

swooped VBD

catching VBG
him PRP

dragged VBD

a DT
fury NN

And CC
he PRP

Arthur NNP

so RB
taken VBN

I PRP

Then RB

Very RB

The DT

I PRP

Here RB
he PRP

I PRP

In IN
such JJ

I PRP

then RB
I PRP

Together RB
we PRP

I PRP

God NNP

how WRB

Every DT

It PRP

somewhat RB

as IN

finally RB

At IN

after IN

he PRP

I PRP

even RB

that IN

so RB
when WRB

It PRP

after IN

long RB

he PRP

I PRP

as IN

I PRP

He PRP

very RB

his PRP$

His PRP$

his PRP$

Jonathan NNP

I PRP

he PRP

fierce JJ

I PRP
asked VBD
Jonathan NNP
why WRB
he PRP

he PRP

evidently RB
thinking VBG
that IN
I PRP

`` ``

His PRP$

The DT
poor JJ

he PRP

He PRP

a DT

out IN

The DT

Jonathan NNP

In IN

where WRB

the DT

coming VBG
over RB

found VBD
the DT
Professor NNP
holding VBG

a DT
tiny JJ
child NN

When WRB

saw VBD
me PRP
he PRP
held VBD
it PRP
out RP

me PRP

and CC
said VBD
: :
'' ''
Are VBP

'' ''
`` ``
No UH

'' ''
I PRP
said VBD
, ,
in IN
a DT
way NN
that IN
I PRP
felt VBD

aggressive JJ

`` ``
Do VBP
you PRP
not RB

`` ``
Yes UH

And CC

it PRP
wounded VBD

'' ''
I PRP
asked VBD

`` ``
We PRP

'' ''
said VBD
the DT
Professor NNP
, ,
and CC
with IN
one CD
impulse NN
we PRP
took VBD
our PRP$
way NN
out IN
of IN
the DT
churchyard NN
, ,
he PRP
carrying VBG
the DT
sleeping VBG
child NN

When WRB
we PRP
had VBD
got VBN
some DT
little JJ
distance NN
away RB
, ,
we PRP
went VBD
into IN
a DT
clump NN
of IN
trees NNS
, ,
and CC
struck VBD
a DT
match NN
, ,
and CC
looked VBD
at IN
the DT
child NN

throat NN

It PRP
was VBD
without IN

scar NN
of IN
any DT

`` ``

I PRP
right RB

'' ''
I PRP
asked VBD
triumphantly RB

`` ``
We PRP
were VBD
just RB
in IN

'' ''
said VBD
the DT
Professor NNP
thankfully RB

We PRP
had VBD
now RB
to TO
decide VB
what WP
we PRP
were VBD
to TO
do VB
with IN
the DT
child NN
, ,
and CC
so RB
consulted VBN
about IN
it PRP

If IN
we PRP
were VBD
to TO
take VB
it PRP
to TO
a DT
police-station NN
we PRP
should MD
have VB
to TO
give VB
some DT
account NN
of IN

during IN

night NN

at IN

we PRP
should MD
have VB
had VBN
to TO
make VB
some DT
statement NN
as IN
to TO
how WRB
we PRP
had VBD
come VBN
to TO
find VB
the DT
child NN

So RB
finally RB
we PRP
decided VBD
that IN
we PRP
would MD
take VB
it PRP
to TO
the DT
Heath NNP
, ,
and CC
when WRB
we PRP
heard VBD
a DT
policeman NN
coming VBG

would MD
leave VB
it PRP
where WRB
he PRP

not RB
fail VB

it PRP

we PRP

then RB
seek VB
our PRP$

home NN
as RB
quickly RB
as IN
we PRP

All DT
fell VBD
out RP
well RB

At IN
the DT
edge NN
of IN
Hampstead NNP
Heath NNP
we PRP
heard VBD
a DT
policeman NN

heavy JJ
tramp NN

and CC
laying VBG
the DT

on IN
the DT
pathway NN

we PRP
waited VBD

watched VBD
until IN
he PRP

it PRP
as IN
he PRP
flashed VBD
his PRP$
lantern JJ
to TO

fro VB

We PRP
heard VBD
his PRP$
exclamation NN
of IN
astonishment NN
, ,
and CC
then RB
we PRP
went VBD
away RB
silently RB

By IN
good JJ
chance NN
we PRP
got VBD
a DT
cab NN
near IN
the DT
`` ``

drove VB
to TO

I PRP
can MD
not RB

so IN
I PRP
make VBP
this DT

But CC
I PRP
must MD
try VB

as IN
Van NNP

He PRP

27 CD

It PRP
was VBD
two CD
o'clock NN
before IN
we PRP
found VBD
a DT
suitable JJ
opportunity NN
for IN
our PRP$
attempt NN

The DT
funeral JJ
held NN
at IN
noon NN
was VBD
all DT
completed VBN

and CC
the DT
last JJ
stragglers NNS
of IN
the DT

had VBD
taken VBN
themselves PRP
lazily RB
away RB

when WRB
, ,
looking VBG
carefully RB
from IN
behind IN
a DT
clump NN
of IN
alder-trees NNS

we PRP
saw VBD
the DT
sexton NN
lock VBZ
the DT

after IN
him PRP

We PRP

then RB
that IN
we PRP

safe JJ

did VBD
we PRP

but CC
the DT
Professor NNP
told VBD
me PRP
that IN

more JJR

an DT

at IN

Again VBP
I PRP
felt VBD
that IN
horrid JJ

reality NN

in IN
which WDT
any DT

I PRP

the DT
perils NNS

which WDT
we PRP

incurring VBG
in IN
our PRP$
unhallowed JJ
work NN

Besides IN

I PRP
felt VBD
it PRP
was VBD
all DT
so RB
useless JJ

Outrageous JJ
as IN
it PRP
was VBD
to TO
open VB
a DT
leaden JJ
coffin NN

to TO
see VB
if IN
a DT

dead JJ
nearly RB
a DT

really RB
dead JJ

it PRP
now RB
seemed VBD
the DT
height NN

folly RB

again RB

when WRB
we PRP

from IN

that IN
the DT

empty JJ

I PRP
shrugged VBD
my PRP$

however RB

rested VBD
silent NN

for IN
Van NNP
Helsing NNP

a DT

no DT

He PRP

the DT

opened VBD
the DT

again RB
courteously RB
motioned VBN

The DT
place NN

not RB

gruesome JJ
as IN
last JJ
night NN

but CC
oh UH

how WRB
unutterably RB
mean-looking NN
when WRB
the DT

Van NNP
Helsing NNP
walked VBD

Lucy NNP

I PRP

He PRP
bent VBD

again RB

the DT

then RB
a DT
shock NN

dismay NN
shot NN
through IN

There EX

Lucy NNP

seemingly RB
just RB

we PRP

seen VBN
her PRP$
the DT

before IN

She PRP

if IN

more RBR
radiantly RB
beautiful JJ

and CC
I PRP
could MD
not RB

The DT

red JJ

nay RB
redder JJR

before RB

and CC
on IN
the DT

was VBD
a DT
delicate JJ
bloom NN

`` ``

'' ''
I PRP
said VBD
to TO
him PRP

`` ``

'' ''
said VBD
the DT
Professor NNP
in IN
response NN
, ,
and CC
as IN
he PRP
spoke VBD
he PRP
put VBD
over RP
his PRP$
hand NN
, ,
and CC
in IN
a DT
way NN
that IN
made VBD
me PRP
shudder VB
, ,
pulled VBD
back RP
the DT
dead JJ
lips NNS
and CC
showed VBD
the DT
white JJ

`` ``

he PRP

`` ``

Once RB

I PRP

such JJ
an DT

with IN
an DT

ashamed VBD

I PRP
had VBD
no DT

so RB

silent JJ

Van NNP
Helsing VBG

not RB

notice VB
my PRP$

at IN
any DT

he PRP

neither CC

He PRP

raising VBG

looking VBG

once RB
more RBR
opening VBG

examining VBG

Then RB
he PRP
turned VBD

She PRP

When WRB
we PRP

come VBN
close RB

I PRP
looked VBD
well RB
at IN
Arthur NNP

for IN
I PRP
feared VBD
that IN
the DT
proximity NN

laden NN
with IN
so RB
sorrowful JJ
a DT

would MD
upset VB
him PRP

but CC
he PRP
bore VBD

well RB

I PRP
took VBD
it PRP
that IN

very RB
mystery NN

some DT

a DT

The DT
Professor NNP
unlocked VBD
the DT

seeing VBG
a DT
natural JJ
hesitation NN
amongst VBZ
us PRP
for IN
various JJ

solved VBD

difficulty NN
by IN
entering VBG
first JJ
himself PRP

The DT
rest NN

followed VBD

and CC
he PRP
closed VBD
the DT

He PRP
then RB
lit VBD
a DT
dark JJ

pointed VBD

Arthur NNP

hesitatingly RB

Van NNP

He PRP

again RB

Arthur NNP
looked VBD
on IN

very RB
pale JJ

silent JJ

when WRB
the DT
lid NN

removed VBN
he PRP
stepped VBD
forward RB

He PRP
evidently RB

not RB

at IN

When WRB

the DT
blood NN
rushed VBD

an DT

as IN
quickly RB
fell VBD

again RB

Van NNP
Helsing NNP
forced VBD
back RP
the DT

we PRP
all DT

recoiled VBD

The DT

For IN
several JJ

Two CD

I PRP

something NN

next JJ

That DT

One CD
more JJR
so RB

we PRP

it PRP

thank VBD
God NNP

Yesterday NN
I PRP

sundown JJ

I PRP

here RB
all PDT
the DT
night NN

the DT
sun NN
rose VBD

but CC
I PRP
saw VBD
nothing NN

It PRP
was VBD
most RBS
probable JJ
that IN
it PRP

because IN
I PRP

laid VBN

Last JJ

there EX

so RB
to-night JJ
before IN

sundown NN
I PRP
took VBD
away RP

And CC
so IN
it PRP

we PRP

Each DT

As IN

Van NNP
Helsing NNP

he PRP

employed VBN
in IN
a DT
definite JJ
way NN

First NNP
he PRP

a DT
mass NN

looked VBD

thin JJ

wafer-like JJ
biscuit NN

which WDT

carefully RB

next CC

out RP

He PRP
crumbled VBD

up RB
fine JJ

This DT
he PRP
then RB

I PRP

somewhat RB

Arthur NNP

Quincey NNP
drew VBD

There EX

At IN

the DT

that IN
I PRP

Mrs. NNP
Harker NNP

so IN
I PRP

: :
`` ``

and CC

I PRP

just RB

Mrs. NNP
Harker NNP

when WRB
she PRP

She PRP

sweetly RB
pretty RB

but CC
very RB
sad JJ

her PRP$

were VBD
flushed VBN
with IN

This DT
somehow NN

Of IN

God NNP

the DT

now RB
the DT

those DT
sweet JJ
eyes NNS

brightened VBD
with IN
recent JJ
tears NNS

went VBD
straight RB
to TO
my PRP$

So CC
I PRP
said VBD
as RB
gently RB
as IN

: :
'' ''

She PRP

After IN

I PRP

with IN
Dr. NNP

his PRP$
study NN

He PRP
brought VBD
back RP
the DT

I PRP
took VBD

He PRP
placed VBD
me PRP

comfortable JJ
chair NN

arranged VBD
the DT
phonograph NN
so IN
that IN
I PRP

showed VBD
me PRP
how WRB
to TO
stop VB
it PRP
in IN

Then RB
he PRP
very RB
thoughtfully RB

a DT
chair NN

me PRP

so IN
that IN
I PRP

I PRP
put VBD

metal NN

listened VBN

When WRB
the DT
terrible JJ
story NN

Lucy NNP

all DT
that WDT

back RB

powerless NN

Fortunately RB
I PRP

not RB

When WRB

hurriedly RB

wild JJ

He PRP
accordingly RB
set VBD
the DT
phonograph NN
at IN

slow JJ

I PRP
began VBD
to TO
typewrite VB
from IN
the DT
beginning NN

the DT
seventh JJ

I PRP
used VBD
manifold NN
, ,

three CD

just RB
as IN
I PRP
had VBD
done VBN
with IN
all PDT
the DT

It PRP

late JJ

when WRB

so IN
that IN

not RB

lonely JJ

How WRB
good JJ

the DT

even RB

Before IN

That IN
going VBG

They PRP

Mrs. NNP

every DT

I PRP
wonder VBP

they PRP

Here RB
it PRP

Strange MD
that IN
it PRP

Goodness NNP

Stop NNP

that IN

He PRP

I PRP
hardly RB

when WRB

I PRP
suppose VBP
I PRP

What WP
a DT
good JJ
thing NN
that IN
Mrs. NNP

We PRP
never RB

I PRP

At IN

he PRP
seemed VBD
as RB

as IN
any DT

I PRP
ever RB

I PRP
sat VBD
down RB

talked VBN

him PRP

all DT

He PRP
then RB

of IN

a DT

he PRP

never RB

In IN
fact NN

he PRP
spoke VBD
quite RB
confidently RB

at IN

I PRP
believe VBP
that IN
, ,
had VBD
I PRP
not RB
had VBD
the DT

read VBD
the DT

I PRP

As IN

I PRP

All PDT

What WP

I PRP

quite VB

out IN

All DT

dark JJ

Not RB

all DT

that IN

that WDT

slowness NN
across IN

have VB
a DT
sentience NN

a DT
vitality NN
of IN

I PRP
think VBP
that IN
the DT
digression NN
of IN
my PRP$

must MD
have VB
done VBN
me PRP
good JJ
, ,
for IN
when WRB
I PRP
got VBD

I PRP
found VBD
a DT
lethargy JJ
creeping NN
over IN

I PRP
lay VBD
a DT

, ,
but CC

not RB
quite RB
sleep JJ

so IN
I PRP
got VBD
out RB
and CC
looked VBD
out IN

again RB

The DT
mist NN
was VBD
spreading VBG

and CC
was VBD
now RB
close RB
up IN

the DT
house NN
, ,
so IN
that IN
I PRP
could MD
see VB
it PRP
lying VBG
thick JJ
against IN

as IN
though IN

stealing VBG
up RB

The DT
poor JJ
man NN
was VBD
more RBR
loud JJ

though IN

not RB
distinguish VB
a DT

he PRP

I PRP

in IN

way NN
recognise NN

some DT
passionate VBP
entreaty NN
on IN

Then RB
there EX

the DT
sound NN
of IN

I PRP
knew VBD

I PRP

so RB

putting VBG

I PRP

not RB
then RB
a DT
bit NN
sleepy JJ

at IN

I PRP
thought VBD

but CC
I PRP
must MD
have VB
fallen VBN

, ,
for IN

except IN

I PRP
do VBP
not RB
remember VB
anything NN
until IN
the DT
morning NN
, ,
when WRB
Jonathan NNP
woke VBD
me PRP

I PRP
think VBP
that IN
it PRP
took VBD
me PRP
an DT
effort NN

a DT
little JJ
time NN
to TO
realise VB

I PRP

that IN

Jonathan NNP

My PRP$

very RB
peculiar JJ

almost RB

that IN

I PRP
thought VBD

waiting VBG

I PRP

very RB
anxious JJ

I PRP

powerless NN

; :
my PRP$
feet NNS

my PRP$

my PRP$

so IN

And CC
so RB
I PRP
slept VBP
uneasily RB

Then RB
it PRP
began VBD

dawn VB
upon IN
me PRP
that IN

dank NN

cold NN

I PRP
put VBD
back RP
the DT

my PRP$

and CC
found VBD

to TO
my PRP$
surprise NN
, ,
that IN
all DT

dim VBN
around RB

The DT
gaslight NN
which WDT
I PRP
had VBD
left VBN
lit NN
for IN
Jonathan NNP

but CC
turned VBD
down RB

came VBD
only RB
like IN

tiny JJ
red JJ

through IN
the DT

which WDT

evidently RB

poured VBD

Then RB
it PRP

that IN

some DT

even RB

I PRP
lay VBD

that DT

I PRP
closed VBD

( (
It PRP

The DT

I PRP

how WRB
it PRP

through IN

It PRP

till VB
it PRP
seemed VBD

some DT
such JJ

But CC

for IN
to-day JJ
I PRP

In IN

Poor NNP

Some DT

I PRP

This DT

Jonathan NNP

that IN
the DT

me PRP
good JJ

for IN
I PRP

how WRB

I PRP

After IN

all DT

off IN

I PRP

He PRP
very RB
kindly RB

up RP
a DT

draught NN

which WDT
he PRP
gave VBD

me PRP

telling VBG

me PRP
no DT

as IN
it PRP
was VBD
very RB
mild JJ
... :

I PRP
have VBP
taken VBN
it PRP
, ,
and CC
am VBP
waiting VBG
for IN

, ,
which WDT
still RB
keeps VBZ
aloof JJ

I PRP
hope VBP
I PRP
have VBP
not RB
done VBN

, ,
for IN
as IN
sleep NN

to TO
flirt VB
with IN
me PRP
, ,
a DT

that IN
I PRP

unhappily RB
he PRP

The DT

he PRP

begun VBN
too RB
early JJ
on IN

I PRP
learned VBD
, ,
however RB

from IN
his PRP$

who WP
seemed VBD
a DT
decent NN

poor JJ

that IN

He PRP

distinctly RB
a DT
good JJ

reliable JJ
type NN
of IN

with IN
a DT

He PRP
remembered VBD
all DT

from IN
a DT
wonderful JJ
dog's-eared JJ

which WDT
he PRP
produced VBD

some DT

If IN

the DT

these DT

chosen VBN

the DT
first JJ

so IN
that IN

he PRP

The DT
systematic JJ
manner NN

He PRP

I PRP
went VBD

if IN

The DT

The DT

I PRP

The DT

it PRP

easy JJ

Van NNP

The DT

The DT
wounds NNS

superficial JJ

a DT

extending VBG

The DT

As IN

I PRP

The DT

from IN

I PRP

I PRP

the DT

The DT

Inured NNP

death NN

this DT

the DT

The DT

I PRP

one CD

At IN

I PRP

it PRP

We PRP

With IN

around IN

out RP
our PRP$

without IN

with IN

Van NNP

just RB

Godalming VBG

Quincey NNP
in IN

just RB
out IN

ready NN

We PRP
waited VBD
in IN
a DT
suspense NN
that WDT

the DT

with IN
nightmare JJ
slowness NN

The DT
slow JJ

careful JJ
steps NNS
came VBD
along IN

the DT
Count NNP
was VBD
evidently RB
prepared VBN
for IN
some DT
surprise NN
at IN

he PRP
feared VBD
it PRP

Suddenly RB
with IN
a DT
single JJ
bound NN
he PRP
leaped VBD
into IN
the DT

, ,
winning VBG
a DT
way NN
past IN
us PRP
before IN
any DT

us PRP
could MD
raise VB
a DT

him PRP

There EX

something NN
so RB
panther-like JJ
in IN

something NN
so RB
unhuman JJ
, ,
that IN
it PRP
seemed VBD
to TO
sober VB
us PRP
all DT
from IN
the DT
shock NN
of IN
his PRP$

The DT
first JJ
to TO
act VB
was VBD
Harker NNP

who WP
, ,
with IN
a DT
quick JJ
movement NN

threw VBD
himself PRP
before IN
the DT
door NN
leading VBG
into IN
the DT
room NN
in IN
the DT
front NN
of IN
the DT

As IN
the DT
Count NNP
saw VBD
us PRP
, ,
a DT
horrible JJ
sort NN
of IN
snarl NN
passed VBN
over IN
his PRP$
face NN

showing VBG
the DT
eye-teeth JJ
long JJ

but CC
the DT
evil JJ
smile NN
as IN
quickly RB
passed VBN
into IN
a DT
cold JJ

of IN
lion-like JJ

His PRP$
expression NN
again RB
changed VBN
as IN
, ,
with IN
a DT
single JJ
impulse NN

we PRP
all DT
advanced VBD
upon IN
him PRP

It PRP
was VBD
a DT
pity NN
that IN
we PRP
had VBD
not RB
some DT
better JJR
organised VBD
plan NN
of IN

for IN
even RB
at IN
the DT

I PRP

what WP

I PRP
did VBD
not RB
myself PRP

whether IN

Harker NNP
evidently RB
meant VBD

try VB
the DT

, ,
for IN
he PRP
had VBD
ready JJ
his PRP$
great JJ
Kukri NNP
knife NN
and CC
made VBD
a DT
fierce JJ
and CC
sudden JJ
cut NN
at IN
him PRP

The DT
blow NN
was VBD
a DT
powerful JJ
one CD

only RB
the DT
diabolical JJ
quickness NN
of IN
the DT
Count's NNP
leap VBZ
back RB
saved VBN
him PRP

A DT
second JJ
less NN

the DT
trenchant NN
blade NN
had VBD
shorne VBN
through IN
his PRP$
heart NN

As IN
it PRP
was VBD
, ,
the DT
point NN
just RB
cut VBD
the DT
cloth NN
of IN
his PRP$

making VBG
a DT
wide JJ
gap NN
whence NN
a DT
bundle NN
of IN
bank-notes NNS
and CC
a DT
stream NN
of IN
gold NN
fell VBD
out RB

The DT
expression NN
of IN
the DT
Count NNP

face NN
was VBD
so RB
hellish JJ
, ,
that IN
for IN
a DT
moment NN
I PRP

though IN
I PRP
saw VBD
him PRP
throw VB
the DT
terrible JJ
knife NN

again RB
for IN
another DT

Instinctively RB
I PRP
moved VBD
forward RB
with IN
a DT
protective JJ
impulse NN
, ,
holding VBG
the DT
Crucifix NNP
and CC
Wafer NNP
in IN
my PRP$

I PRP
felt VBD
a DT
mighty NN
power NN
fly NN
along IN

it PRP

without IN

that IN
I PRP

monster NN
cower NN
back RB

a DT

made VBD
spontaneously RB
by IN
each DT

It PRP
would MD
be VB
impossible JJ
to TO

the DT
expression NN
of IN
hate NN

baffled VBD
malignity NN
of IN
anger NN
and CC
hellish JJ
rage NN
which WDT
came VBD
over IN
the DT
Count NNP

face NN

His PRP$
waxen JJ
hue NN
became VBD
greenish-yellow JJ
by IN
the DT
contrast NN
of IN
his PRP$
burning VBG
eyes NNS

the DT
red JJ
scar NN
on IN
the DT

showed VBD

the DT
pallid JJ

like IN

The DT
next JJ
instant NN

with IN
a DT

he PRP

grasping VBG

Amid IN

Through IN

With IN

Last JJ

only RB

A DT

There EX

Here RB

Van NNP

I PRP

Quincey NNP

whilst JJ
Harker NNP

instinctively RB

There EX

We PRP

we PRP

useless JJ

Suddenly RB
she PRP

up RB

Van NNP

we PRP

with IN

The DT

the DT

so IN
it PRP

that IN

already RB

We PRP

that IN

on IN
the DT

so CC
what WP

have VBP

to TO

The DT

thing NN

what WP

we PRP

then RB

get VB
a DT

on IN
what WP
his PRP$
later JJ
task NN
is VBZ
to TO

Firstly RB

We PRP

differentiate VB
between IN
what WP
he PRP
did VBD
in IN
London NNP
as IN
part NN
of IN
his PRP$
general JJ
plan NN
of IN
action NN
, ,
when WRB
he PRP
was VBD
pressed VBN
for IN
moments NNS
and CC
had VBD
to TO
arrange VB

best JJS
he PRP

Secondly RB
we PRP

see VB

as RB
well RB
as IN
we PRP

surmise VB
it PRP
from IN
the DT
facts NNS
we PRP
know VBP
of IN
, ,
what WP
he PRP
has VBZ
done VBN
here RB
. .
As IN
to TO
the DT
first JJ
, ,
he PRP
evidently RB
intended VBD
to TO
arrive VB
at IN
Galatz NNP
, ,
and CC
sent VBD
invoice NN
to TO
Varna NNP
to TO
deceive VB
us PRP
lest JJS
we PRP
should MD
ascertain VB
his PRP$
means NNS
of IN
exit NN
from IN
England NNP
; :
his PRP$
immediate NN
and CC
sole NN
purpose NN
then RB
was VBD
to TO
escape VB
. .
The DT
proof NN
of IN
this DT
, ,
is VBZ
the DT
letter NN
of IN
instructions NNS
sent VBD
to TO
Immanuel NNP
Hildesheim NNP
to TO
clear VB
and CC
take VB
away RP
the DT

before IN

There EX
is VBZ
also RB
the DT
instruction NN
to TO
Petrof NNP
Skinsky NNP

These DT
we PRP
must MD
only RB
guess VB
at IN

but CC
there EX
must MD
have VB
been VBN
some DT
letter NN
or CC
message NN
, ,
since IN
Skinsky NNP
came VBD
to TO
Hildesheim NNP

That DT
, ,
so RB
far RB
, ,
his PRP$

were VBD
successful JJ
we PRP
know VBP

The DT
Czarina NNP
Catherine NNP
made VBD
a DT
phenomenally RB
quick JJ
journey NN
so RB
much RB
so IN
that IN
Captain NNP
Donelson's NNP
suspicions NNS
were VBD
aroused VBN
; :
but CC
his PRP$
superstition NN
united VBD
with IN
his PRP$
canniness NN
played VBD
the DT
Count NNP

game NN
for IN
him PRP
, ,
and CC
he PRP
ran VBD
with IN
his PRP$
favouring NN
wind NN
through IN
fogs NNS
and CC
all DT
till NN
he PRP
brought VBD
up RP
blindfold NN
at IN
Galatz NNP

That IN
the DT
Count NNP
's POS
arrangements NNS
were VBD
well RB
made VBN
, ,
has VBZ
been VBN
proved VBN
. .
Hildesheim NNP
cleared VBD
the DT
box NN
, ,
took VBD
it PRP
off RP
, ,
and CC
gave VBD
it PRP
to TO
Skinsky NNP
. .
Skinsky NNP
took VBD
it PRP
and CC
here RB
we PRP
lose VBP
the DT
trail NN
. .
We PRP
only RB
know VBP
that IN
the DT
box NN
is VBZ
somewhere RB
on IN
the DT
water NN
, ,
moving VBG
along RB
. .
The DT
customs NNS
and CC
the DT
octroi NN
, ,
if IN
there EX
be VB
any DT
, ,
have VBP
been VBN
avoided VBN
. .
Now RB
we PRP
come VBP
to TO
what WP
the DT
Count NN
must MD
have VB
done VBN
after IN
his PRP$
arrival NN
on IN
land NN
, ,
at IN
Galatz NNP
. .
The DT
box NN
was VBD
given VBN
to TO
Skinsky NNP
before IN
sunrise NN
. .
At IN
sunrise NN
the DT
Count NNP
could MD
appear VB
in IN
his PRP$
own JJ
form NN
. .
Here RB
, ,
we PRP
ask VBP
why WRB
Skinsky NNP
was VBD
chosen VBN
at IN
all DT
to TO
aid NN
in IN
the DT
work NN
? .
In IN
my PRP$
husband NN
's POS
diary JJ
, ,
Skinsky NNP
is VBZ
mentioned VBN
as IN
dealing VBG
with IN
the DT
Slovaks NNP
who WP
trade VBP
down RP
the DT
river NN
to TO
the DT
port NN
; :
and CC
the DT
man's NN
remark NN
, ,
that IN
the DT
murder NN
was VBD
the DT
work NN
of IN
a DT
Slovak NNP
, ,
showed VBD
the DT
general JJ
feeling NN
against IN
his PRP$
class NN
. .
The DT
Count NNP
wanted VBD
isolation NN
. .
My PRP$
surmise NN
is VBZ
, ,
this DT
: :
that DT
in IN
London NNP
the DT
Count NNP
decided VBD
to TO
get VB
back RB
to TO
his PRP$
castle NN
by IN
water NN
, ,
as IN
the DT
most RBS
safe JJ
and CC
secret JJ
way NN
. .
He PRP
was VBD
brought VBN
from IN
the DT
castle NN
by IN
Szgany NNP
, ,
and CC
probably RB
they PRP
delivered VBD
their PRP$
cargo NN
to TO
Slovaks NNP
who WP
took VBD
the DT
boxes NNS
to TO
Varna NNP
, ,
for IN
there EX
they PRP
were VBD
shipped VBN
for IN
London NNP
. .
Thus VB
the DT
Count NNP
had VBD
knowledge NN
of IN
the DT
persons NNS
who WP
could MD
arrange VB
this DT
service NN
. .
When WRB
the DT
box NN
was VBD
on IN
land NN
, ,
before IN
sunrise NN
or CC
after IN
sunset NN
, ,
he PRP
came VBD
out RP
from IN
his PRP$
box NN
, ,
met VBD
Skinsky NNP
and CC
instructed VBD
him PRP
what WP
to TO
do VB
as IN
to TO
arranging VBG
the DT
carriage NN
of IN
the DT
box NN
up IN
some DT
river NN
. .
When WRB
this DT
was VBD
done VBN
, ,
and CC
he PRP
knew VBD
that IN
all DT
was VBD
in IN
train NN
, ,
he PRP
blotted VBD
out RP
his PRP$
traces NNS
, ,
as IN
he PRP
thought VBD
, ,
by IN
murdering VBG
his PRP$
agent NN
. .
I PRP
have VBP
examined VBN
the DT
map NN
and CC
find VB
that IN
the DT
river NN
most RBS
suitable JJ
for IN
the DT
Slovaks NNP
to TO
have VB
ascended VBN
is VBZ
either CC
the DT
Pruth NNP
or CC
the DT
Sereth NNP
. .
I PRP
read VBP
in IN
the DT
typescript NN
that IN
in IN
my PRP$
trance NN
I PRP
heard VBD
cows NNS
low JJ
and CC
water NN
swirling VBG
level NN
with IN
my PRP$
ears NNS
and CC
the DT
creaking NN
of IN
wood NN
. .
The DT
Count NN
in IN
his PRP$
box NN
, ,
then RB
, ,
was VBD
on IN
a DT
river NN
in IN
an DT
open JJ
boat NN
propelled VBD
probably RB
either RB
by IN
oars NNS
or CC
poles NNS
, ,
for IN
the DT
banks NNS
are VBP
near IN
and CC
it PRP
is VBZ
working VBG
against IN
stream NN
. .
There EX
would MD
be VB
no DT
such JJ
sound NN
if IN
floating VBG
down RP
stream NN
. .
Of IN
course NN
it PRP
may MD
not RB
be VB
either CC
the DT
Sereth NNP
or CC
the DT
Pruth NNP
, ,
but CC
we PRP
may MD
possibly RB
investigate VB
further RBR
. .
Now RB
of IN
these DT
two CD
, ,
the DT
Pruth NNP
is VBZ
the DT
more RBR
easily RB
navigated VBN
, ,
but CC
the DT
Sereth NNP
is VBZ

at IN
Fundu NNP

joined VBN
by IN
the DT
Bistritza NNP
which WDT
runs VBZ
up RP

the DT

The DT

it PRP

Now RB
to TO
the DT
historical JJ
, ,
for IN
as IN
Madam NNP
Mina NNP

not RB

her PRP$
stenography NN
, ,
I PRP
must MD
, ,
in IN
my PRP$
cumbrous JJ
old JJ
fashion NN
, ,
that WDT
so RB
each DT
day NN
of IN

unrecorded JJ

We PRP
got VBD
to TO
the DT
Borgo NNP
Pass NNP
just RB
after IN
sunrise NN
yesterday NN
morning NN
. .
When WRB
I PRP
saw VBD
the DT
signs NNS
of IN
the DT
dawn NN
I PRP
got VBD
ready JJ
for IN
the DT
hypnotism NN
. .
We PRP
stopped VBD
our PRP$
carriage NN
, ,
and CC
got VBD
down RB
so RB
that IN
there EX
might MD
be VB
no DT
disturbance NN
. .
I PRP
made VBD
a DT
couch JJ
with IN
furs NNS
, ,
and CC
Madam NNP
Mina NNP
, ,
lying VBG
down RP
, ,
yield VB
herself PRP
as IN
usual JJ
, ,
but CC
more JJR
slow JJ
and CC
more RBR
short JJ
time NN
than IN
ever RB
, ,
to TO
the DT
hypnotic JJ
sleep NN
. .
As IN
before RB
, ,
came VBD
the DT
answer NN
: :
`` ``
darkness NN
and CC
the DT
swirling NN
of IN
water NN
. .
'' ''
Then RB
she PRP
woke VBD
, ,
bright JJ
and CC
radiant JJ
and CC
we PRP
go VBP
on IN
our PRP$
way NN
and CC
soon RB
reach VBP
the DT
Pass NNP
. .
At IN
this DT
time NN
and CC
place NN
, ,
she PRP
become VBP
all DT
on IN
fire NN
with IN
zeal NN
; :
some DT
new JJ
guiding VBG
power NN
be VB
in IN
her PRP
manifested VBD
, ,
for IN
she PRP
point NN
to TO
a DT
road NN
and CC
say NN
: :
'' ''
This DT
is VBZ
the DT

'' ''
`` ``
How WRB
know VB

'' ''
I PRP
ask VBP

`` ``
Of IN
course NN
I PRP
know VBP

'' ''
she PRP
answer VBZ
, ,
and CC
with IN
a DT
pause NN
, ,
add VB
: :
`` ``
Have VBP
not RB
my PRP$
Jonathan NNP
travelled VBD
it PRP
and CC
wrote VBD
of IN
his PRP$

? .
'' ''
At IN
first JJ
I PRP
think VBP
somewhat RB
strange JJ
, ,
but CC
soon RB
I PRP
see VBP
that IN
there EX
be VB
only RB
one CD
such JJ
by-road NN
. .
It PRP
is VBZ
used VBN
but CC
little JJ
, ,
and CC
very RB
different JJ
from IN
the DT
coach NN
road NN
from IN
the DT
Bukovina NNP
to TO
Bistritz NNP
, ,
which WDT
is VBZ
more JJR
wide JJ
and CC
hard JJ
, ,
and CC
more JJR
of IN

So IN
we PRP
came VBD
down RB
this DT
road NN
; :
when WRB
we PRP
meet VBP
other JJ
ways NNS
not RB
always RB
were VBD
we PRP
sure VBP
that IN
they PRP
were VBD
roads NNS
at IN
all DT

for IN
they PRP
be VB
neglect JJ
and CC
light JJ
snow NNS
have VBP
fallen VBN
the DT
horses NNS
know VBP
and CC
they PRP
only RB
. .
I PRP
give VBP
rein NN
to TO
them PRP
, ,
and CC
they PRP
go VBP
on IN
so RB
patient JJ

By-and-by NNP
we PRP
find VBP
all PDT
the DT
things NNS
which WDT
Jonathan NNP
have VBP
note VBN
in IN
that DT
wonderful JJ
diary NN
of IN
him PRP

Then RB
we PRP
go VBP
on IN
for IN
long JJ

long JJ
hours NNS

At IN
the DT
first JJ

I PRP

I PRP

But CC
she PRP
sleep VBP

and CC
I PRP

I PRP
do VBP
not RB

sleep NN
at IN

I PRP

I PRP

For IN

Then RB

Presently RB

Jonathan NNP

By IN

I PRP
found VBD
my PRP$

for IN
I PRP
knew VBD
that IN
here RB

The DT

it PRP

as IN

some DT

which WDT

me PRP
dizzy JJ

Either CC
there EX

in IN

or CC
I PRP
heard VBP

off IN

Then RB
I PRP

The DT

Her NNP

I PRP

not RB
dare JJ

yet RB
even RB

I PRP
resolve VBP
me PRP
that IN

and CC
that IN

we PRP

God NNP

At IN
any DT

it PRP

So RB

I PRP

the DT

So RB
I PRP
make VBP
my PRP$

I PRP

Ah NNP

Every DT

The DT

With IN

`` ``

The DT

NOTE NNP
Seven NNP
years NNS
ago IN
we PRP
all DT
went VBD
through IN
the DT
flames NNS
; :
and CC
the DT
happiness NN
of IN
some DT
of IN
us PRP
since IN
then RB
is VBZ
, ,
we PRP
think VBP
, ,
well RB
worth IN
the DT
pain NN
we PRP
endured VBD
. .
It PRP
is VBZ
an DT
added JJ
joy NN
to TO
Mina NNP
and CC
to TO
me PRP
that IN
our PRP$
boy NN
's POS
birthday NN
is VBZ
the DT
same JJ
day NN
as IN
that DT
on IN
which WDT
Quincey NNP
Morris NNP
died VBD
. .
His PRP$
mother NN
holds VBZ
, ,
I PRP
know VBP
, ,
the DT
secret JJ
belief NN
that IN
some DT
of IN
our PRP$
brave NN
friend NN

spirit NN
has VBZ
passed VBN
into IN
him PRP
. .
His PRP$
bundle NN
of IN
names NNS
links VBP
all DT
our PRP$
little JJ
band NN
of IN
men NNS
together RB
; :
but CC
we PRP
call VBP
him PRP
Quincey NNP
. .
In IN
the DT
summer NN
of IN
this DT
year NN
we PRP
made VBD
a DT
journey NN
to TO
Transylvania NNP
, ,
and CC
went VBD
over IN
the DT
old JJ
ground NN
which WDT
was VBD
, ,
and CC
is VBZ
, ,
to TO
us PRP
so RB
full JJ
of IN
vivid NN
and CC
terrible JJ
memories NNS
. .
It PRP
was VBD
almost RB
impossible JJ
to TO
believe VB
that IN
the DT
things NNS
which WDT
we PRP
had VBD
seen VBN
with IN
our PRP$
own JJ
eyes NNS
and CC
heard NN
with IN
our PRP$
own JJ
ears NNS
were VBD
living VBG
truths NNS
. .
Every DT
trace NN
of IN
all PDT
that WDT
had VBD
been VBN
was VBD
blotted VBN
out RP
. .
The DT
castle JJ
stood NN
as IN
before RB
, ,
reared VBD
high JJ
above IN
a DT
waste NN
of IN
desolation NN
. .
When WRB
we PRP
got VBD
home RB
we PRP
were VBD
talking VBG
of IN
the DT
old JJ
time NN
which WDT
we PRP
could MD
all DT
look VB
back RB
on IN
without IN
despair NN
, ,
for IN
Godalming VBG
and CC
Seward NNP
are VBP
both DT
happily RB
married VBN
. .
I PRP
took VBD
the DT
papers NNS
from IN
the DT
safe JJ
where WRB
they PRP
had VBD
been VBN
ever RB
since IN
our PRP$
return NN
so RB
long RB
ago RB
. .
We PRP
were VBD
struck VBN
with IN
the DT
fact NN
, ,
that IN
in IN
all PDT
the DT
mass NN
of IN
material NN
of IN
which WDT
the DT
record NN
is VBZ
composed VBN
, ,
there EX
is VBZ
hardly RB
one CD
authentic JJ
document NN
; :
nothing NN
but CC
a DT
mass NN
of IN
typewriting NN
, ,
except IN
the DT
later JJ
note-books NNS
of IN
Mina NNP
and CC
Seward NNP
and CC
myself PRP
, ,
and CC
Van NNP
Helsing NNP
's POS
memorandum NN
. .
We PRP
could MD
hardly RB
ask VB
any DT
one CD
, ,
even RB
did VBD
we PRP
wish VB
to TO
, ,
to TO
accept VB
these DT
as IN
proofs NN
of IN
so RB
wild JJ
a DT
story NN
. .
Van NNP
Helsing NNP
summed VBD
it PRP
all DT
up RB
as IN
he PRP
said VBD
, ,
with IN
our PRP$
boy NN
on IN
his PRP$
knee NN
: :
'' ''
We PRP
want VBP
no DT
proofs NN
; :
we PRP
ask VBP
none NN
to TO
believe VB
us PRP
! .
This DT
boy NN
will MD
some DT
day NN
know VB
what WP
a DT
brave NN
and CC
gallant JJ
woman NN
his PRP$
mother NN
is VBZ
. .
Already RB
he PRP
knows VBZ
her PRP$
sweetness NN
and CC
loving VBG
care NN
; :
later RB
on IN
he PRP
will MD
understand VB
how WRB
some DT
men NNS
so RB
loved VBD
her PRP
, ,
that IN
they PRP
did VBD
dare VB
much JJ
for IN
her PRP$
sake NN

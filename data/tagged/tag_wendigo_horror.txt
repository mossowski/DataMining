A DT

the DT

But CC

This DT

however RB

found VBD
no DT

Hallucination NN
for IN

simple JJ

so IN

that IN

Besides IN

Joseph NNP
Défago NNP

a DT
French JJ

who WP

before IN

in IN
Rat NNP
Portage NNP
when WRB

Canadian NNP

a-building JJ

a DT
man NN
who WP
, ,
in IN
addition NN
to TO
his PRP$
unparalleled JJ
knowledge NN

could MD
also RB
sing VBG
the DT
old JJ
_voyageur_ JJ
songs NNS
and CC
tell VB
a DT
capital NN

into IN

He PRP
was VBD
deeply RB
susceptible JJ

moreover RB
, ,
to TO
that DT
singular NN
spell NN
which WDT
the DT
wilderness NN
lays VBZ
upon IN
certain JJ
lonely JJ
natures NNS

and CC
he PRP
loved VBD
the DT
wild JJ
solitudes NNS
with IN
a DT
kind NN
of IN
romantic JJ
passion NN
that WDT
amounted VBD
almost RB
to TO
an DT
obsession NN

The DT
life NN
of IN
the DT
backwoods NNS
fascinated VBD
him PRP
-- :
whence NN
, ,
doubtless NN
, ,
his PRP$
surpassing VBG
efficiency NN
in IN
dealing VBG
with IN
their PRP$
mysteries NNS

On IN
this DT
particular JJ
expedition NN
he PRP
was VBD
Hank NNP

choice NN

Hank NNP
knew VBD
him PRP
and CC
swore RB
by IN
him PRP

He PRP
also RB
swore VBP
at IN
him PRP
, ,
`` ``
jest NN
as IN
a DT

'' ''
and CC
since IN
he PRP
had VBD
a DT
vocabulary NN

if IN
utterly JJ
meaningless NN
, ,
oaths NNS
, ,
the DT
conversation NN
between IN
the DT
two CD
stalwart NN

hardy JJ
woodsmen NNS
was VBD
often RB
of IN
a DT
rather RB
lively JJ
description NN

This DT
river NN
of IN
expletives NNS
, ,
however RB
, ,
Hank NNP
agreed VBD
to TO
dam VB
a DT
little JJ
out IN
of IN
respect NN
for IN
his PRP$
old JJ
`` ``

'' ''
Dr. NNP
Cathcart NNP
, ,
whom WP
of IN
course NN
he PRP
addressed VBD
after IN
the DT
fashion NN
of IN
the DT
country NN
as IN
`` ``
Doc NNP

'' ''
and CC
also RB
because IN
he PRP
understood VBD
that IN
young JJ
Simpson NNP
was VBD
already RB
a DT
`` ``

'' ''
He PRP
had VBD
, ,
however RB
, ,
one CD
objection NN
to TO
Défago NNP
, ,
and CC
one CD
only RB
-- :
which WDT
was VBD
, ,
that IN
the DT
French JJ
Canadian JJ
sometimes RB
exhibited VBD
what WP
Hank NNP
described VBD
as IN
`` ``
the DT
output NN
of IN

cursed JJ

dismal JJ
mind NN

'' ''
meaning VBG
apparently RB
that IN
he PRP
sometimes RB
was VBD
true JJ
to TO
type VB
, ,
Latin NNP
type NN
, ,
and CC
suffered VBD
fits NNS
of IN
a DT
kind NN
of IN
silent JJ
moroseness NN
when WRB
nothing NN
could MD
induce VB
him PRP
to TO
utter VB
speech NN

Défago NNP
, ,
that WDT
is VBZ
to TO
say VB
, ,
was VBD
imaginative JJ
and CC
melancholy JJ

And CC
, ,
as IN
a DT
rule NN
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
too RB
long RB
a DT
spell NN
of IN
`` ``

'' ''
that WDT
induced VBD
the DT
attacks NNS

for IN
a DT
few JJ
days NNS
of IN

wilderness NN
invariably RB
cured VBD
them PRP

This DT
, ,
then RB

was VBD
the DT
party NN

four CD

found VBD
themselves PRP
in IN

the DT
last JJ

in IN
October NNP
of IN

`` ``

up RP
in IN
the DT
wilderness JJ
north NN
of IN
Rat NNP
Portage NNP

a DT
forsaken JJ

desolate JJ
country NN

There EX

Punk NNP

an DT
Indian JJ

who WP

accompanied VBN
Dr. NNP
Cathcart NNP

Hank NNP
on IN

hunting NN
trips NNS
in IN
previous JJ
years NNS

who WP

His PRP$

merely RB

He PRP

, ,
except IN

his PRP$
coarse JJ

more RBR
like IN

redskin NN
than IN
a DT

Negro NNP

For IN
all DT
that DT

however RB

for IN

without IN

discovering VBG
itself PRP

Défago NNP
had VBD
sung VBN
his PRP$
song NN
and CC
plunged VBD
into IN
a DT
story NN
, ,
but CC
Hank NNP
, ,
in IN
bad JJ
humor NN

reminded VBD
him PRP
so RB
often RB
that IN
`` ``

that IN

that IN

finally RB
subsided VBN

a DT
sulky NN

nothing NN

likely JJ

Dr. NNP
Cathcart NNP

were VBD
fairly RB
done VBN
after IN
an DT
exhausting JJ
day NN

Punk NNP

washing VBG
up RP

grunting VBG

himself PRP
under IN

lean-to NN

where WRB

No DT

Overhead CC

there RB

The DT

Hank NNP
broke VBD

suddenly RB

`` ``

His PRP$

It PRP

Even RB

The DT

One CD

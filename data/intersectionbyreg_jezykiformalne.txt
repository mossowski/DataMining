We investigate the complexity of languages described by some expressions
containing shuffle operator and intersection. We show that deciding whether
the shuffle of two words has a nonempty intersection with a regular set
(or fulfills some regular pattern) is NL-complete.

Furthermore we show that the class of languages of the form  $L\cap R$,
with a shuffle language $L$ and a regular language $R$,  contains
non-semilinear languages and does not form a family of mildly
context-sensitive languages.

formal languages, shuffle, space complexity

Parallel composition of words appears to be an important issue both in the
theory of concurrency and formal languages. Usually it is modeled by the
shuffle operation. If the class of regular languages is extended by the
shuffle operation $\odot$ and the iteration of the shuffle operation,
$\otimes$, then we obtain the class of shuffle languages $SL$, which is useful
in describing concurrent non-communicating processes \cite{Sh}.
We know \cite{JS} that for each shuffle language $L$ there exists a one-way
nondeterministic Turing machine which decides the membership problem for
$L$ in logarithmic space. This implies that shuffle languages are
context sensitive and that they are recognizable in
polynomial time. But the shuffle operation can be helpful to describe more
complex languages.
Warmuth and Haussler \cite{War}   show that if we add the intersection operation
then we can obtain an NP-complete language, namely the language
 $\{\$a^nb^nc^nd^n \mid
n\ge 0\}^\otimes = \big((\$ + abcd)^\otimes \cap (\$a^*b^*c^*d^*)\big)^\otimes$.
They  also show that the problem of deciding for any words
$w, w_1,\dots, w_n\in \{a,b,c\}^*$ whether
$w\in w_1\odot \cdots\odot w_n$
is NP-complete.

In this paper we consider some languages described with the help of both the
shuffle operations and the intersection with regular sets.
Firstly, we consider languages of the form
$\{u\$v\mid u\odot v\cap R\ne\emptyset\}$ or
$\{u\$v\mid u\odot v\subset R\}$,
where $R$ is a regular language.
The latter is
the problem of deciding whether the shuffle of two
words fulfills the  regular pattern $R$.
We show that every such language belongs to $NL$ (is acceptable in
nondeterministic logarithmic space) and that there exists
an $NL$-complete language of each of these forms.
 We also show that there are $NL$-complete languages of the form
$\{u\mid u\odot u\cap R\ne\emptyset\}$ or
$\{u\mid u\odot u\subset R\}$.

Furthermore we consider the class $SL\wedge Reg=
\{L\cap R\mid \;L\in SL,\;R\in Reg\}$ of languages represented as the
intersection of a shuffle language and a regular one. The reason for starting
this investigation was, as it seemed, the connection of $SL\wedge Reg$ with
mildly context-sensitive languages
considered in \cite{MVM} and
defined as follows:
A family $\cal L$ is a mildly context-sensitive family of languages if
each language in $\cal L$ is semilinear, and recognizable in
deterministic polynomial time, and
if $\cal L$ contains the following three  languages:
multiple agreements, crossed agreements and duplications.
The class $SL \wedge Reg$  seemed a good candidate for
a family of mildly context-sensitive languages in view of fulfilling the
condition of polynomial complexity of membership problem \cite{JS} and neat
description of multiple agreements and crossed agreements by suitable
expressions.
In this paper we show that $SL \wedge Reg$ contains some non-semilinear
languages and does not contain $L_3$. Hence $SL \wedge Reg$
does not form a family of mildly context-sensitive languages.

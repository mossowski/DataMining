man's remark 
steam launch 
bank lest 
chance thrust 
boat service 
stream whence 
devouring monster 
steam launch 
train to-night 
furnace door 
steam launch 
place chosen 
danger hanging 
river seeming 
furnace door 
furnace heat 
rest needful 
chase afresh 
warm furs 
roaring water 
sunrise yesterday 
yesterday morning 
answer darkness 
coach road 
sun flow 
mountain rise 
sleep till 
sun rise 
comfort round 
round till 
None safer 
horizon life 
transparent gloom 
response none 
blacksmith hammer 
work lay 
work lay 
mouth present 
head whirl 
spoke eloquent 
bloody foam 
work undone 
vampire sleep 
sheer precipice 
look look 
way round 
tail wagging 
Look Look 
break-neck speed 
rifle ready 
age whilst 
resolute tone 
gypsy party 
screeching sound 
sinking sun 
setting sun 
Look look 
mountain top 
brave friend 
document nothing
